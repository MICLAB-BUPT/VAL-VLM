Here's the integrated logical chain of events:

1) A group of people, some wearing yellow vests, gather in a city street, causing tension among the crowd.  
2) The tension leads to chaos as people start fighting and throwing objects in the street.  
3) The chaotic situation results in the arrival of a police van, from which officers dismount to confront the crowd.  
4) The confrontation escalates, leading to the arrival of police on horseback attempting to control the crowd.  
5) The presence of mounted police causes the crowd to shift and gather near a building and at a train station.  
6) The large crowd at the train station results in police managing the crowd, while more scenes show people standing near another building with mounted officers present.  
7) As the situation intensifies, a massive crowd fills the street, prompting police on horseback to disperse them using smoke canisters.  
8) The use of smoke canisters causes the crowd to react by running away, leading to continued police efforts to maintain order.  
9) The dispersion and control efforts result in the final scene showing the aftermath, with police officers and horses maintaining presence amidst the crowd.
