The anomaly event unfolds as follows:

1) A chaotic nighttime scene on a city street with a dense crowd of protesters or rioters creates a tense atmosphere, accompanied by significant smoke likely from tear gas.

2) The chaos leads to someone in the crowd setting off a firework.

3) The firework explodes, resulting in a bright flash and additional smoke, which exacerbates the disorder and tension.
