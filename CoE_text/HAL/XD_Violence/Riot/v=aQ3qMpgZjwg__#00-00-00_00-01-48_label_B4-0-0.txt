1) A man in a green jacket stands on a street, speaking to the camera, which leads to the camera showing a group of police officers in riot gear behind him.  
2) The police officers, wearing helmets and shields, are standing in formation, which results in the camera panning around to show a crowd gathered on the street.  
3) The crowd is holding signs or banners, and as the man continues to speak, the scene shifts to a wider view of the street.  
4) This wider view shows police officers marching down the road, causing the crowd to watch from the sidewalks.  
5) Finally, the video concludes with a close-up shot of two men standing outside a house, engaged in conversation.
