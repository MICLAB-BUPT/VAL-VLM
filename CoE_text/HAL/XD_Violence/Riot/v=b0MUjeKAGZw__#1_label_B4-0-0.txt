1) The video shows a group of people walking down a street, dressed in various types of clothing.  
2) As they walk, an explosion or fire suddenly occurs nearby, causing panic and smoke.  
3) The smoke-filled area leads to the group running away from the danger.  

This establishes a logical chain of events: 1 (peaceful walk) → 2 (sudden explosion/fire causes panic) → 3 (group flees due to danger).
