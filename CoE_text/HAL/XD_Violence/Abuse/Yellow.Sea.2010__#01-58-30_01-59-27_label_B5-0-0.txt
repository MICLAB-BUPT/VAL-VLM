1) A man in a striped shirt is seen torturing or interrogating another gagged and tied-up man, creating an intense and violent atmosphere.  
2) The man in the striped shirt makes a phone call, which leads to a shift in the scene.  
3) The scene cuts to a different man in a suit, who is also making a call, suggesting communication between the two individuals.  
4) The man in the suit is then shown walking through a parking garage, which is unusual because the previous scenes were set indoors and did not show any outdoor locations.  
5) This sudden change of setting causes confusion and raises questions about the connection between the two men and their activities.
