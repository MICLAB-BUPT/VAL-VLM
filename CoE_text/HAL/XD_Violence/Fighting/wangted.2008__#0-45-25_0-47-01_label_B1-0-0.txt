Here is a logical integration of the two scenarios into a coherent sequence using cause-effect transitions:

1) A man in a brown shirt grabs a woman's hair and pulls her towards him, causing a physical altercation.  
2) The woman struggles to resist but finds it difficult, leading to visible distress.  
3) This struggle distracts the other individuals in the room, resulting in an environment of heightened tension.  
4) A man in a red shirt notices the altercation and becomes aggressive, initiating a fight with another man who appears distressed.  
5) The woman, now free from the initial attacker, intervenes to stop the fight between the two men.  
6) She successfully subdues the man in the red shirt, leading to his defeat and injury on the ground.  
7) The distressed man, now standing, takes advantage of the situation by picking up a gun.  
8) Despite the woman's attempts to stop him, he shoots the injured man in the red shirt.  
9) The shooting leaves the woman in horror as she witnesses the violent act.  
10) The distressed man walks away, abandoning the woman in the aftermath.  

This sequence weaves both scenarios into a single narrative with clear causal links.
