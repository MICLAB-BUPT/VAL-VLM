Here is the logical chain of events integrating both answers:

1) The hockey game between Colorado and Anaheim is ongoing, tied at 1-1 in the third period.

2) A physical altercation breaks out between players near the center circle, causing tension among everyone present.

3) This tension leads to an unusual anomaly where two men in suits push each other, drawing attention away from the game.

4) The situation with the men in suits is eventually controlled by officials or security.

5) Following this incident, play resumes and Colorado scores, resulting in a 2-1 lead.
