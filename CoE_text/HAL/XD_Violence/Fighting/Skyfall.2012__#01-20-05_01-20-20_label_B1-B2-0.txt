Here's a logical sequence integrating both answers:

1) A man in a suit is shot by an unknown assailant, causing him to fall to the ground.  
2) This event leads to the suited man getting up, which results in him retaliating.  
3) His retaliation causes another man (with blonde hair) to be shot and fall to the ground.  
4) The suited man continues shooting other people, leading them to fall as well.
