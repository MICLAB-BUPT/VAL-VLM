1) A man stands on a dock at night with a serious expression, looking off into the distance (Answer 2).
2) His concerned demeanor leads him to engage in conversation with another man who approaches from behind (Answer 1).
3) The discussion escalates as the first man tries but fails to convince the second man, causing agitation.
4) The agitation leads the first man to attack the second man.
5) The attack results in a fight where both men fall to the ground.
6) After the struggle, the first man stands over the second man with a cold expression (Answer 1).
7) This confrontation leaves him walking away seriously, as seen in Answer 2.

This sequence combines elements from both answers, showing the progression from initial concern to conflict and its aftermath.
