Here's a logical sequence integrating both answers:

1) A physical altercation begins when player 76 in a black jersey skates towards the goal and engages with a white jersey player.

2) This initial clash leads other players to join, intensifying the fight near the goal.

3) The chaos causes referees to intervene, attempting to separate the players on the ice.

4) Despite their efforts, the altercation continues off the ice, with players pushing and shoving each other.

5) The ongoing conflict results in a visibly upset crowd, where some fans stand while others watch the drama unfold.

6) Eventually, referees manage to break up the fight and escort the involved players off the ice.
