Here's a logical chain integrating both answers:

1) A man drives a car down a narrow street with two motorcyclists behind him.  
2) The motorcyclists chase the car, causing the driver to swerve in an attempt to avoid them.  
3) Swerving leads to the motorcyclists losing balance and falling off their bikes.  
4) Despite this, the motorcyclists continue their pursuit, chasing the car through the city streets.  
5) To evade the motorcyclists, the driver loses control of the vehicle.  
6) Loss of control results in the car crashing into a wall and flipping over.  
7) The crash causes debris to fly everywhere and the car to come to a stop upside down.
