Here is an organized sequence integrating both video descriptions with cause-and-effect logic:

1) A man in a black coat walks through tall grass with a gun, searching for something or someone.

2) He aims the gun off-screen, leading to a shot being fired.

3) The shot causes another man, also in a black coat, to be injured and lie on the ground.

4) After the injury, the shooter approaches and helps the injured man up.

5) Following this interaction, there is a scene shift to a snowy field with birds flying overhead, providing a different context or part of the story.

6) The video concludes with the injured man lying on the ground in the tall grass area, incapacitated.
