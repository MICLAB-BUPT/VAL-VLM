1) The pursuit by another man causes the first man to jump from one rooftop to another.  
2) Jumping from the rooftop leads to him landing on a large red and black air mattress.  
3) Landing on the air mattress results in him sitting up and cautiously looking around.  
4) Sitting up and looking around makes him vulnerable, leading to an attack from behind by another man.  
5) The attack causes the first man to quickly disarm the attacker and take his gun.  
6) Disarming the attacker and obtaining the second gun results in the first man standing up, holding both guns, and appearing determined.
