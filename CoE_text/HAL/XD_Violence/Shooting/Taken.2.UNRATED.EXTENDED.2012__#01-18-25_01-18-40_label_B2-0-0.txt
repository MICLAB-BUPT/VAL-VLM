Here is the integrated logic chain of events:

1) A man in a dark jacket and pants walks down a dimly lit hallway and approaches a railing.

2) He suddenly falls through the floor into a dark room below. (Cause: The structural weakness or a trigger causes the fall.)

3) The fall startles someone on the balcony, who then picks up a gun.

4) The person on the balcony fires the gun, causing smoke to billow from the railing. (Lead to: The gunshot startles the man in the hallway.)

5) The man in the hallway, reacting to the gunshot, throws a grenade towards the balcony. (Result of: Being startled or threatened by the gunfire.)

6) The grenade explodes upon reaching the balcony, sending debris into the air and causing chaos.

7) The explosion leads to the man in the hallway ducking for cover as debris flies around him. (Resulting from: The explosive force and flying debris.)

8) The explosion also causes injury or disorientation to the man in the hallway due to the blast impact.

9) As a result of his injuries, the man becomes disoriented and loses consciousness.

10) Finally, he ends up lying on the ground, unconscious. (Resulting from: The combination of the fall, gunshot, grenade explosion, and subsequent injuries.)

This chain connects both scenarios, showing how each event leads to the next, culminating in the man's unconscious state.
