1) A man holds a gun.  
2) This causes another man to start running in the dark.  
3) The runner leads to the scene showing a cityscape at night with a bridge illuminated by green lights.  
4) The bridge scene transitions to an underwater view where a figure is swimming rapidly through murky water, struggling or in distress.  
5) The movement underwater results in bubbles and light rays visible in the water.  
6) This activity leads to a dark, murky environment where there's a faint outline of something moving.
