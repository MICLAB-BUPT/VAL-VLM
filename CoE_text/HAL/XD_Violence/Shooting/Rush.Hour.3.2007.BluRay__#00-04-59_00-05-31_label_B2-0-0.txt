Here is a coherent logical chain of events integrating both scenarios:

1) The conference room setting with a man speaking at a podium and attendees seated around a table creates an environment where security might be a concern.

2) A sniper's scope focuses on the speaker, indicating a potential threat, which causes tension and sets up for possible action.

3) Another man in the room, possibly a security personnel, notices the danger through binoculars, leading him to react.

4) The man reacts by running up the stairs with a gun, likely attempting to escape or intervene to prevent the assassination.

5) His actions, however, draw attention from the sniper, who then targets him instead of the speaker.

6) The sniper shoots the intervening man, resulting in his fall and creating a sudden sense of urgency and danger in the scene.
