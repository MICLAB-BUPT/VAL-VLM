1) A soldier in camouflage gear walks through a barren landscape, carrying a rifle.  
2) This scene transitions to a field of tall grass where an explosion occurs, causing debris and dust to fill the air.  
3) The explosion leads to more explosions and smoke rising from the ground.  
4) The presence of explosions results in a tank moving through the field.  
5) The tank's movement causes it to leave a trail of smoke behind.  
6) Despite the ongoing explosions, the tank continues to move forward.  
7) The continuous movement of the tank and the explosions result in a wide shot of the field with smoke still billowing in the distance.
