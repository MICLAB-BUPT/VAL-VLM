The logical chain of events in the video can be constructed as follows:

1) The war-torn urban environment creates a setting of intense conflict and danger.

2) Soldiers engage in combat, navigating through rubble-strewn streets while taking cover and firing weapons.

3) Amidst this chaos, a soldier wearing a green jacket is shot in the back by another soldier, also dressed in green.

4) The shooting causes the injured soldier to fall to the ground, unconscious or severely wounded.

5) Another soldier notices the fallen comrade and rushes to provide assistance, checking his condition and offering help.

This sequence effectively integrates both answers using cause-effect relationships.
