Here is the integrated logic chain of the anomaly event:

1) The video begins with a man in a suit pointing a gun at someone off-screen on a dock at night, which causes tension and sets a confrontational scene. 

2) The young girl, who is already lying injured or unconscious on the ground, becomes the target of the man's anger, leading to the next action.

3) The man yells angrily at the girl, which results in him pulling the trigger. 

4) He shoots the girl, causing her to fall to the ground, and this leads to another man standing over her. 

5) After shooting the girl, the man stands over her lifeless body, which results in him walking away from the scene.

6) Finally, the video ends with the man in the suit standing alone on the dock at night, looking around cautiously, as a result of the events that transpired.
