1) A soldier lies prone on the ground, wearing camouflage gear and a helmet, aiming his rifle at a distant target in a barren landscape.  
2) The soldier fires his rifle, causing a bullet to hit the ground.  
3) The bullet hitting the ground leads to an unusual event: a small explosion erupting from the impact point.  
4) This anomaly results in a cloud of dust and an unexpected explosive reaction, differing from typical bullet impacts.
