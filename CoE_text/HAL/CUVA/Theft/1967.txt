1) The residential area is calm and quiet with a white pickup truck parked in the driveway and a red car passing by on the street normally.  
2) This leads to the red car deviating from its usual path on the street.  
3) As a result, the red car causes an anomaly by driving into the driveway.  
4) Consequently, it stops next to the white pickup truck, creating an unusual situation.
