2) This leads to a blue 'GRADALL' truck arriving, stopping near the parking meter, and then reversing away.  
3) The GRADALL truck's presence causes a blue forklift to approach the scene.  
4) The forklift operator lifts the parking meter, moves it to the side of the street, adjusts its position, and secures it upright.
