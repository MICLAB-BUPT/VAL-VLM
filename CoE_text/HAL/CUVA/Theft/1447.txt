The logic chain of the anomaly event can be constructed as follows:

1) A person approaches the black car, gets inside, and prepares to drive normally.

2) The car starts moving forward on its own without any visible human interaction (anomaly).

3) This results in a smooth, continuous movement without signs of manual pushing or pulling.
