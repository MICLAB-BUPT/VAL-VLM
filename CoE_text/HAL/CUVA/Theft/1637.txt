1) The man in a suit begins his presentation, displaying a cityscape with a Ferris wheel behind him.  
2) This presentation leads to the detection of an anomaly in the system.  
3) The anomaly results in a break-in at a jewelry store, captured by security cameras showing the intruder breaking open a safe and fleeing with a bag.  
4) Simultaneously, the anomaly causes panic in an office space, where another individual is seen moving frantically and erratically.  
5) Both incidents—the jewelry store break-in and the office disturbance—are part of the same anomaly event.
