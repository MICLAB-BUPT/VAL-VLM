Here is the logical sequence integrating both answers:

1. The video footage, timestamped April 24, 2019, at 14:32:27, shows a car dealership with multiple cars parked inside and a person in the background.  
2. A person approaches one of the parked cars.  
3. Upon reaching the car, it suddenly starts moving without any visible driver, suggesting either remote control or mechanical malfunction.  
4. The autonomous movement of the car leads to it driving around the dealership's interior.  
5. As a result, the car passes by other parked vehicles and office furniture inside the dealership.  
6. This unusual event is captured in the surveillance footage, which then transitions to an exterior night view, showing a person walking towards the dealership entrance.  
7. Subsequently, the car is seen driving away from the dealership and exiting the frame, completing the sequence of events.
