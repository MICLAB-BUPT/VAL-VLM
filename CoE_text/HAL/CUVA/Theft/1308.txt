1) An empty office space with cubicles is initially observed on a black and white security camera.

2) A person wearing a reflective vest enters from the left side, causing movement in the previously static environment.

3) This leads to the individual walking towards the center of the room.

4) Upon reaching the center, the person exits to the right side, continuing the pattern.

5) The office returns to being empty after the first person exits, only to have another person in a reflective vest enter from the right side.

6) This causes further movement as the second individual walks towards the center.

7) The second person then exits to the left side, mirroring the path of the first but in the opposite direction.

8) This pattern of entry and exit repeats with different individuals, resulting in repeated movements within the office.

9) However, during one such instance, a person wearing both a reflective vest and a cap enters from the left side, causing a noticeable deviation from the usual behavior.

10) This individual walks to the center, pauses briefly, leading to a momentary stillness that stands out.

11) The pause causes a slight disruption in the otherwise consistent flow of people moving through the space.

12) After the brief pause, the person exits to the right side, marking the end of this particular movement but highlighting an anomaly in their behavior.
