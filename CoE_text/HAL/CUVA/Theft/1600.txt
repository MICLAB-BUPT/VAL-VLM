Here's a logical chain integrating both answers:

1) A man in a white shirt and black pants carries a black bag while sneaking around a house, moving quickly to avoid detection.  
2) His suspicious behavior causes the video to transition to an outdoor view of the house with a large tarp covering part of it.  
3) The man's actions lead to him being captured on nighttime surveillance running out of the house.  
4) This results in the final scene where the man and a woman in a purple dress are seen together inside the house.
