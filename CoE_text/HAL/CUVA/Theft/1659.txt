1) The video begins with a black and white security camera view of the Cook County Sheriff's Office, showing people entering and exiting through glass doors.  
2) This leads to a transition in scenes, first showing a close-up of a desk with various items and then moving to a parking lot at night where several cars are parked in rows, with a person walking towards the camera.  
3) The scene shifts back to the security camera view of the office, where a group of people are seen running inside, which results in increased activity captured by the camera.  
4) This causes the video to cut to another angle of the parking lot, showing more people walking around and interacting with each other.  
5) The anomaly event occurs when a person wearing a blue jacket and jeans is seen running towards the camera from the parking lot, which is unusual for this setting.  
6) This leads to heightened attention on the individual's movement, as it stands out from the otherwise routine activities in the video.
