Here's a logical integration of the two answers into a coherent sequence using appropriate connectors:

1) A man wearing a black jacket and blue jeans throws a fireball at another individual, causing him to fall backward.  
2) This action leads to flames spreading rapidly across the street.  
3) The spreading flames result in increased destruction and chaos in the area.  
4) The intensifying chaos causes an explosion inside a nearby store.  
5) The explosion results in people attempting to escape the burning building.  

This sequence combines both answers, ensuring all key events are logically connected.
