1) A group of people, including women and children, decide to dance energetically in the middle of a busy highway during daytime with clear skies.  
2) This unusual activity causes the traffic around them to stop or slow down significantly.  
3) The stopped traffic leads to a safe environment for the dancers to perform their choreographed routine without any accidents or incidents.  
4) The dancers, wearing casual and bright-colored clothing, take advantage of the halted traffic to move their arms and legs rhythmically.  
5) This results in a joyful and unique scene where people are able to dance freely in the middle of what is normally a high-speed roadway.
