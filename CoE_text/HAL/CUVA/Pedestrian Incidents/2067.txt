Here is the integrated logic chain of the anomaly event:

1) Violent incidents occur in India's Manipur state.  
2) These incidents cause buildings and structures to burn.  
3) The burning buildings lead to intense fires and thick smoke.  
4) This results in people running away in panic and fear.  
5) The chaotic situation leads to distress and conflict among the population.  
6) All these factors result in widespread destruction and an environment of unrest and turmoil.
