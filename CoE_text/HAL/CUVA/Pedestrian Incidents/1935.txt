1) The video begins with a street scene showing parked cars and a sidewalk on 2022-07-21 at 19:43:45.  
2) Ground cracking and sinking suddenly occur, causing a large hole to appear in the sidewalk.  
3) People nearby notice the anomaly and react by moving away from the area.  
4) The ground collapse leads to debris accumulation, as shown in a close-up view of the hole.  
5) A landslide is reported in Yunnan on July 19, causing a house to collapse and resulting in two deaths.  
6) The camera transitions to show a man inspecting the debris near a steep drop-off.  
7) The event is concluded as an earthquake described as a "ground collapse."  

This logical chain connects each event using cause-effect relationships to present a coherent sequence of the anomaly.
