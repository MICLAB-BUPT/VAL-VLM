1) The nighttime setting causes artificial lighting from street lamps or building lights.  
2) This leads to the creation of shadows and contrast between illuminated areas and darker surroundings.  
3) The environment becomes quiet and still, with no other characters or movement except for the main subject.  
4) A person wearing a light blue shirt and dark pants enters the scene.  
5) The person walks towards the camera, capturing attention due to the otherwise still environment.  
6) Upon reaching a certain point, the person turns around, changing direction.  
7) They then walk back in the opposite direction away from the camera.  
8) This results in the subject exiting the frame, leaving the scene as quiet and still as before their arrival.
