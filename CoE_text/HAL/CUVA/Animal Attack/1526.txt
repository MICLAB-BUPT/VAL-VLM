1) A man in a white shirt and shorts is walking down a street with a small dog on a leash.  
2) As he walks, he frequently stops and looks around, appearing to search for something or someone, which causes him to pick up an object from the ground.  
3) Picking up the object leads to his attention being diverted, resulting in him switching focus from the dog to a cat.  
4) The man then begins walking with a small, fluffy cat on a leash, which pulls and resists, causing him to struggle to control it.
