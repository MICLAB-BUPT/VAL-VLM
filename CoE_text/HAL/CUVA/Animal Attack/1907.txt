1) A video shows a young boy playing with a dog on the street.  
2) The boy is wearing a black jacket and blue jeans; the dog has a black and white coat. They are in an alleyway with debris scattered around.  
3) The boy throws a stick for the dog to fetch, which causes the dog to jump up and catch it mid-air.  
4) This leads to the dog bringing the stick back to the boy, resulting in continued play.  
5) As they continue, the setting transitions to include buildings and parked cars, and the boy switches to throwing a ball instead of a stick.  
6) The dog fetches the ball, continuing their playful interaction.
