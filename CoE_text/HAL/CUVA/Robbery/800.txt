1) A nighttime city street scene is set with storefronts, artificial lighting, shadows, muted colors, and wet surfaces from recent rain.  
2) A person rides a scooter on this wet surface.  
3) The wet surface causes the scooter to lose traction.  
4) This leads to the rider losing control of the scooter.  
5) Losing control results in the rider falling off the scooter.  
6) After the fall, the rider chases after the moving scooter.  
7) The pursuit leads to the rider catching up with the scooter.  
8) Catching up allows the rider to grab onto the back and continue riding briefly.  
9) However, the wet surface again causes the rider to lose control.  
10) This second loss of control results in another fall from the scooter.
