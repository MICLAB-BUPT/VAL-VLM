Here is a structured logic chain of the events, integrating both answers:

1) A man in a yellow hazmat suit holds a gun, signaling potential criminal activity.  
2) This leads to the initiation of a bank robbery.  
3) The robbery results in an explosion at a parking garage, possibly as a diversion.  
4) The explosion causes chaos and draws police attention.  
5) Meanwhile, a man in a black coat observes from a rooftop, prompting him to break into the bank.  
6) He takes money from safety deposit boxes, leading to a hostage situation inside.  
7) Police respond with flashing lights, attempting to track the robbers but face challenges.  
8) The man escapes by driving a van through city streets as part of his escape plan.  
9) Despite police efforts, he successfully evades capture and joins others around a fire.  
10) The group discusses their next move after escaping with the stolen money.  

This chain connects each event using cause and effect to create a coherent narrative.
