1) A woman in a white coat, presumably a pharmacist, is standing behind the counter of a pharmacy filled with medications and products.  
2) She interacts with a customer, who appears to be a man wearing a black shirt and dark pants.  
3) The man becomes agitated during the interaction, gesturing with his hands while talking to the pharmacist.  
4) His agitation causes him to lunge towards the pharmacist, grabbing her by the shoulders and pushing her against the counter.  
5) This action leads to the pharmacist becoming visibly distressed but attempting to maintain composure.  
6) The man then releases her and walks away from the counter, resulting in the pharmacist standing alone behind the counter.
