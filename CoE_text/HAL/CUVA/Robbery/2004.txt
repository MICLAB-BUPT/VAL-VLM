1) The bank robbery begins as an armed robber enters the bank.  
2) This causes the security guard to engage with the robber, holding his gun in defense.  
3) During the engagement, the guard interacts with someone off-screen, leading to his sudden fall due to injury or reaction.  
4) His fall results in him being unable to defend himself effectively.  
5) Consequently, he is shot by the armed robber, which ultimately leads to his death.
