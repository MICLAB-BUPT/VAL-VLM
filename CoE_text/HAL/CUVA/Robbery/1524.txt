Here's the logical chain of events based on the given scenarios:

1) A man enters a post office.  
2) He climbs onto the counter and takes money from the cash register.  
3) This theft causes the police to initiate an investigation.  
4) During their investigation, they discover a shoe print on the floor at the scene.  
5) The shoe print leads them to identify the suspect's movements.  
6) Meanwhile, the man enters another room where he climbs onto a counter again.  
7) He interacts with a computer monitor, likely searching for specific information.  
8) His actions in the second location result in further police attention as they track his activities.  
9) Consequently, the police gather more evidence and continue their pursuit, leading to increased surveillance of the area.
