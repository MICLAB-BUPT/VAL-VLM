Here is the logical chain of events:

1) The man on a bicycle is engaged in a conversation with another person inside a parked car.  
2) This engagement leads to him standing still for a period.  
3) After the conversation, he gets on his bicycle and rides away suddenly.  
4) His sudden movement causes an unexpected action.  
5) This results in adding an element of surprise to the otherwise ordinary street scene.
