Here is the integrated logical chain of events:

1) The man discusses his life's impact on a helipad.  
2) His discussion leads to him running away from pursuing FBI agents.  
3) Running causes a chase, resulting in his apprehension by the agents.  
4) Apprehension results in processing, shown by the height measurement.  
5) Processing leads to him being escorted through various locations, including a dimly lit nightclub.  
6) In the nightclub, expressing regret over a drug bust leads to further consequences.  
7) Consequently, he is led out of a restaurant by the FBI, with a chef preparing food in the background.
