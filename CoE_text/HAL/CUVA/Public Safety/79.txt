Here is the integrated logic chain of events:

1. The video begins with a view of a normal street in Yerevan, Armenia, showing parked cars and buildings.

2. An earthquake occurs, causing smoke and debris to fall from the sky, leading to a chaotic atmosphere.

3. The chaos from the earthquake results in explosions, possibly due to damaged infrastructure such as gas lines.

4. These explosions cause further destruction, including large plumes of smoke, flying debris, and severely damaged buildings.

5. The increased destruction leads to people fleeing the area in panic.

6. Emergency services respond to the scene to address both the earthquake damage and subsequent explosions.

7. The video concludes with an aerial view showing the extent of the destruction from both events.

8. Finally, news articles about the combined disaster are displayed on a smartphone screen, summarizing the impact of the earthquake and explosions.
