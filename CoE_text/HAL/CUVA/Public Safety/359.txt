1) The authorities implement extensive measures to control the spread of COVID-19.  
2) This causes the deployment of large trucks equipped with mist sprayers to disinfect public areas at night.  
3) These trucks spray disinfectant over streets, sidewalks, and other surfaces, leading to a reduction in viral contamination.  
4) As a result, people in protective suits conduct further disinfection efforts on vehicles and various surfaces during the night.  
5) The next day, this leads to lines of individuals gathering for COVID-19 testing.  
6) Medical staff administer tests to these people, causing an increase in sample collection for analysis.  
7) Consequently, medical personnel work in laboratories handling samples and conducting tests.  
8) This results in a better understanding of the virus spread and informs ongoing pandemic management efforts.
