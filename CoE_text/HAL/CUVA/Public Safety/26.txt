1) The video begins with a news anchor introducing the event, displaying surveillance footage of a man near trash bags on the sidewalk (cause).  
2) This leads to the man approaching the pile of trash bags (leads to).  
3) He rummages through them, causing him to pick up one bag (results in).  
4) The man then walks away with the bag and subsequently throws it into the street (causes an unusual action).  
5) This behavior is identified as an anomaly because it is uncommon for individuals to discard trash in public spaces (results in recognizing the anomaly).
