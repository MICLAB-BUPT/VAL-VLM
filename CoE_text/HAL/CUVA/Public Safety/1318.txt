Here's a structured logical chain integrating both answers:

1) Police officers, dressed in tactical gear with helmets and vests labeled "POLICE," approach a suspected drug lab in Guangdong.

2) They enter the building cautiously, with one officer holding a firearm, which leads to them moving through the premises carefully.

3) While inside, they encounter resistance from an individual on the ground, resulting in the officers subduing the person.

4) The successful apprehension of the suspect inside causes the officers to secure the outdoor area next.

5) Securing the area results in the detention of additional individuals, who are then escorted away from the building.

6) Throughout the operation, text overlays provide context about the raid and the suspects involved.
