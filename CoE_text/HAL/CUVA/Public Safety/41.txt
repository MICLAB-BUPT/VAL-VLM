1) A large yellow excavator and a white truck are being transported across a narrow, makeshift metal bridge in a mountainous area.  
2) The weight of the heavy machinery causes the bridge to become unstable.  
3) As the excavator moves forward, it begins to tilt, leading to a loss of balance.  
4) The tilting of the excavator results in the collapse of the metal bridge.  
5) The collapse of the bridge leads to both vehicles falling into the rocky terrain below.  
6) The impact causes a massive cloud of dust and debris to rise from the ground.  
7) Debris from the collapse also falls into the river, creating a large splash.
