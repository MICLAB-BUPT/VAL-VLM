1) The traffic light turns green at an intersection where a black SUV is stopped in front of a gray car.  
2) As the light changes, the black SUV begins moving forward.  
3) Simultaneously, the driver's side door of the gray car opens, caused by the person inside noticing an issue.  
4) A person wearing an orange shirt and black pants exits the vehicle, appearing to be in distress or discomfort.  
5) They hold their stomach, indicating possible physical discomfort, which leads to them walking away from the car.  
6) The person returns to the gray car, opens the driver's side door again, and starts searching for something inside.  
7) After searching momentarily, they close the door, which results in them deciding to investigate further by walking to the front of the car.  
8) They open the hood of the gray car, presumably to check for mechanical issues or other problems.  
9) After closing the hood, the person walks away once more, leaving the gray car still parked at the intersection.  
10) The video ends with the gray car remaining stationary while the person in the orange shirt is no longer visible.
