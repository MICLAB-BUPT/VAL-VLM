The logical chain of events leading to the anomaly is as follows:

1) A police officer approaches an individual on a residential street, initiating contact.

2) The individual begins to walk away from the officer, prompting further interaction.

3) The officer chases the individual, causing him to run down the sidewalk.

4) While attempting to evade capture, the individual experiences a sudden loss of balance or tries to avoid being caught.

5) This results in the individual falling to the ground during the chase.
