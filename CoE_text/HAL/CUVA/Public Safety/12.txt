1) The video begins with a view from inside a car, showing a traffic jam on a multi-lane road, which **causes** a white pickup truck in the left lane to stop.  
2) A woman wearing a red shirt and blue jeans opens the driver's side door of the truck, appearing to be in distress or urgency, which **leads to** her stepping out onto the road.  
3) She then gets back into the truck and closes the door, but her frustration or exasperation **causes** her to raise her arms.  
4) This frustration **leads to** her stepping out again, closing the door once more, and walking away from the truck towards the right side of the frame.  
5) Her actions during this anomaly event **result in** her no longer being visible by the end of the video, leaving the truck still stopped in traffic.
