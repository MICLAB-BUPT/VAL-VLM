1) The video is created to depict the spread of COVID-19 cases across China through static images of maps.  
2) These maps are updated from January 20, 2020, to February 28, 2020, with each frame displaying a specific date and the number of confirmed cases for that day.  
3) The use of a color gradient (light blue to dark red) in the maps causes regions with higher case numbers to be visually highlighted, leading to an easy understanding of severity across different provinces.  
4) This visual representation results in a clear timeline showing the progression and containment of COVID-19 in China during this period.  
5) The video further extends its timeline from January 2020 to December 2020, which allows for tracking changes in case numbers over time.  
6) The map's color-coding system leads to distinguishing between regions with less than 500 cases and those with more than 5000 cases, providing a detailed overview of the outbreak's severity.  
7) The conclusion of the video displays a black screen with a QR code and text encouraging viewers to follow for more information, resulting in increased awareness and engagement on COVID-19 updates.
