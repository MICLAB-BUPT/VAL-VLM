Here's a logical chain integrating both answers:

1) A person in a black hoodie grabs one of the girls and runs away, causing commotion.  
2) This action leads to chaos as people start running and panicking inside the Apple store.  
3) The commotion results in a security guard rushing towards the entrance, followed by other staff members.  
4) Customers seek safety, with some huddling together, including a woman in a red dress.  
5) The disturbance causes the store to become empty as people take cover or leave.  
6) Finally, the aftermath leads to staff assessing the situation once the commotion subsides.
