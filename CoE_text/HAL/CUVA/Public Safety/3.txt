Here is the integrated logical chain of events:

1) The video begins by showing a car driving normally through city traffic, with people going about their daily routines.

2) A man in the moving car suddenly opens the door, which causes a collision with another vehicle.

3) This collision leads to a disruption in the flow of traffic and results in a potential risk to other drivers on the road.
