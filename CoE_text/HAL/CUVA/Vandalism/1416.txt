1) The video begins with a title screen featuring a film reel icon and text about the team's name, category, and city, which **leads to** the scene transitioning to two individuals walking in a park-like setting with trees and a wet path.  
2) Their movement **causes** them to approach a fenced area containing statues of deities, where they gather around the statues, observing them closely.  
3) One individual pointing at something on the ground near the statues **results in** the scene shifting to show the group walking away from the statues towards a road.  
4) As they walk, they pass by a building with a blue tarp roof, which **leads to** the video concluding with a credit screen displaying logos and names of sponsors.
