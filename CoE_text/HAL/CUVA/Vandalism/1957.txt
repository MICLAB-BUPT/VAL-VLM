1) The video shows a multi-story building made of red bricks with several windows being demolished by a large excavator equipped with a hydraulic breaker attachment.  
2) As the excavator's arm extends towards the building, it causes the structure to weaken and collapse inward.  
3) The collapse leads to debris falling from the building and creating a cloud of dust.  
4) The demolition process results in the entire building collapsing, leaving behind a significant amount of rubble and dust in the surrounding area.
