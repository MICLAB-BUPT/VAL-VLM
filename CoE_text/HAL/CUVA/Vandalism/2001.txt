1) The boy throws a white object at a stone pillar, causing it to become unstable.  
2) He then attempts to climb an unstable column nearby, which has been weakened by the impact.  
3) His weight on the already compromised structure leads to the column collapsing under stress.  
4) This results in the boy falling to the ground.
