1) A person starts by drawing parallel lines and adding more lines to form a three-dimensional rectangular shape, creating an optical illusion of a hole in the road.

2) The addition of shading and texture enhances the 3D effect, making the painted holes appear more realistic.

3) As vehicles approach, the realistic appearance of the holes causes a humorous illusion where it seems like the vehicles are falling into them.

4) To further enhance the illusion, water is poured into the painted pits, which leads to realistic reflections of the surroundings, adding depth to the visual effect.
