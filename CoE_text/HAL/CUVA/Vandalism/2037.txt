1) A person arrives at an outdoor urban location under an overpass or bridge, wearing a pink shirt and dark/black shorts, bringing spray paint.  
2) This leads to the artist beginning to create a detailed portrait using primarily blue and white colors on the concrete wall.  
3) The process results in the creation of a face with closed eyes, expressing serenity, as they carefully apply the paint while standing on the ground.  
4) Stepping back occasionally causes the artist to assess their progress under the sunny conditions with visible shadows and trees in the background.  
5) This leads to the completion of the artwork, resulting in a serene face portrait on the wall for public display.
