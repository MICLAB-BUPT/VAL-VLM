1. The woman interacts with displays in an art gallery.
2. She accidentally knocks over a large clock, causing it to fall and break.
3. This leads to the man rushing to help her pick up the broken pieces.
4. The man then places the pieces back on the wall, successfully repairing the clock.

This sequence integrates both accounts, showing the woman's accidental action leading to the breakage and the man's role in repairing it.
