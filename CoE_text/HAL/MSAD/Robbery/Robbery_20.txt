1) The video begins with a view of a car dealership showroom, showcasing three cars: a white sports car on the left, a green sports car in the center, and an orange sports car on the right.  
2) Above the green car, there is a cluster of balloons in red, black, and white colors.  
3) Suddenly, two individuals dressed in dark clothing enter the frame from the right side, running towards the green car.  
4) They appear to be in a hurry, possibly attempting to steal or vandalize the vehicle.  
5) One person crouches near the rear of the green car while the other moves around it.  
6) The individual who crouched then stands up and runs out of the frame, followed by the other person.  
7) The green car remains stationary throughout this sequence.  
8) After the individuals leave the frame, the green car starts moving forward slowly, passing the white car and exiting the frame to the left.  
9) The white car then begins to move forward, following the path of the green car.  
10) Both cars exit the frame, leaving the showroom empty except for the balloons above the green car.  
11) The video ends with a static shot of the showroom, focusing on the balloons and the now-empty space where the cars were previously parked.  

The anomaly event in the video is when the green car suddenly reverses and drives away, leaving behind the white car. This unexpected action disrupts the initial setup of the cars parked next to each other with balloons between them.
