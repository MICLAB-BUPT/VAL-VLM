The event unfolds as follows:

1) A man in a black jacket and pants enters an office lobby carrying a large box or package.

2) He looks around, searching for something or someone, which leads him to move towards the security area of the building.

3) Upon reaching the security section, he approaches the glass partition separating the customer service area from the security room.

4) He uses an object from his hand, possibly a tool, to interact with the glass partition, likely attempting to break through or manipulate it.
