1) A man is cleaning a basketball hoop on a wet concrete driveway next to a parked car during daylight.  
2) As he sprays the hoop with a pressure washer, the water pressure causes him to lose his balance.  
3) Losing his balance leads to him falling backward onto the ground.  
4) The fall results in him appearing to be in pain as he lies on the driveway for a moment.  
5) After lying there briefly, he gets up from the ground.
