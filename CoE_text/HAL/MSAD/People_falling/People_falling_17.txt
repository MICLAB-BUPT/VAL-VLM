1) A foggy, overcast day causes the steps to be wet due to rain or dew.  
2) The wet steps lead to the woman slipping as she carries a bucket and approaches them.  
3) The slip causes her to lose her balance while trying to ascend.  
4) Losing balance results in her falling backward onto the steps in slow motion.  
5) The fall, captured in slow motion, emphasizes the slipperiness of the steps and contributes to the soft, muted scene with diffused light from the foggy environment.
