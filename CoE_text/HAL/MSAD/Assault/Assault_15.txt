1) The video takes place in an outdoor corridor with colorful stalls on one side and a building wall on the other, setting the scene for the event.

2) A student wearing a yellow shirt and black pants is seen walking towards another student dressed in a blue uniform with a backpack. 

3) The student in the yellow shirt pushes the student in the blue uniform, causing him to fall to the ground.

4) This action leads to the fallen student being left unaided as other students continue walking without stopping to help.

5) Consequently, the corridor becomes empty except for a third student who remains by the wall, looking at his phone, as seen in the final frame of the video.
