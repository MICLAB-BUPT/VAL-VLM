Here's a coherent logic chain integrating both answers:

1) The person searches the outdoor area with a flashlight, which causes them to approach one of the picnic tables.  
2) At the table, they attempt to break it open by hitting it with the flashlight.  
3) After several unsuccessful hits, they stop and check their surroundings, leading to heightened frustration.  
4) This frustration results in the person using a baseball bat to hit the table aggressively.  

This sequence weaves together elements from both scenarios, showing progression from cautious searching to increased frustration and more aggressive action.
