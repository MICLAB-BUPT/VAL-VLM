1) The artist begins by applying black paint to the bottles, creating a stark contrast against the white background.
2) This initial application of black paint causes the artist to then add details with a brush, focusing on the reflections and highlights to give depth and realism to the bottles.
3) To ensure smooth transitions between shades of black, gray, and brown, the artist uses a palette to mix colors, which in turn allows for the creation of more realistic-looking bottles.
4) After achieving the desired level of detail and realism, the artist adds labels to two of the bottles, writing 'Fitz's' in red letters, and to one bottle, adding 'Drink', enhancing the recognizability and authenticity of the painted objects.
5) The completion of the painting, including the addition of the artist's signature at the bottom right corner, leads to the final scene presenting the finished artwork.
