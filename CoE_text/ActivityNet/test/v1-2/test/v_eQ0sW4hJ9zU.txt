1) The man starts by explaining the features of the red and black lawn mower, which causes him to then demonstrate how to start it using a pull cord.
2) After starting the mower, he begins mowing different areas of the well-maintained lawn, including around a tree and along the edge of the property, which leads to him stopping at some point to adjust something on the lawnmower.
3) Following the adjustment, he continues mowing, ensuring all areas are covered, which results in the completion of the mowing task.
4) Upon finishing mowing, the need to dispose of the collected grass clippings causes him to empty the grass catcher and place the clippings into a bag.
