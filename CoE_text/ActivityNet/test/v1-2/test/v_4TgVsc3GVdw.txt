1) The video begins with a title screen introducing 'Good Hand Hygiene for Children,' which causes the transition to a kitchen setting where two children, one in a pink shirt and the other in a striped shirt, are seated at a table.
2) In the kitchen, the girl in the pink shirt demonstrates hand hygiene by covering her mouth with her elbow when coughing, causing the boy in the striped shirt to mimic this action.
3) Text appears on the screen advising to use a tissue instead of hands and arms, leading both children to then use tissues to cover their mouths while coughing.
4) Following the demonstration of proper cough etiquette, the children proceed to demonstrate proper handwashing techniques, including turning on the water, applying soap, and rubbing their hands together thoroughly.
5) The thorough handwashing, which includes using soap and rubbing their hands together vigorously, leads to them rinsing their hands under running water and drying them using a paper towel.
6) The sequence of demonstrations and actions taken by the children, especially the emphasis on proper hand hygiene practices, results in the video concluding with text on the screen reinforcing the importance of these practices.
