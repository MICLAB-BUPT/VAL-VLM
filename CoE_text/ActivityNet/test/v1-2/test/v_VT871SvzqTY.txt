1) A woman in a blue apron is preparing a salad outdoors, which causes her to start by adding chopped cucumbers to a large bowl.
2) After adding the cucumbers, she then adds sliced green onions and red chili peppers, causing an increase in the variety of ingredients in the salad.
3) The addition of these vegetables causes her to mix the ingredients thoroughly with her hands to ensure they are well distributed.
4) To further enhance the flavor, she adds a liquid ingredient from a bottle, possibly oil or vinegar, which causes her to continue mixing the salad.
5) The need for more flavoring causes her to add another ingredient from a second bottle, likely a sauce or dressing, and she mixes again.
6) Finally, to complete the preparation, she adds a final ingredient from a third bottle, ensuring all components are well combined, which results in a fully prepared salad.
