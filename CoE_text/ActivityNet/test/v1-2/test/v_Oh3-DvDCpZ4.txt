1) The chef is cooking pasta in a professional kitchen, which causes the environment to be well-organized and equipped with stainless steel appliances.
2) The chef uses tongs to toss and mix the pasta in a pan over an open flame, which ensures the pasta is well-coated with a rich, red tomato-based sauce.
3) The precise and controlled movements of the chef as they manipulate the pasta in the pan cause the pasta to be evenly coated with the sauce.
