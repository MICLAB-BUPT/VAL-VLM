1) The woman in the video starts by placing a bottle, which is already wrapped in pink paper, on a table covered with a blue cloth.
2) She then cuts a piece of white lace fabric, which causes her to have the material needed to wrap around the bottle.
3) After cutting, she proceeds to wrap the white lace fabric around the bottle, ensuring it is neatly arranged, which leads to the enhancement of the bottle's appearance.
4) Next, she adds a pink ribbon to the top of the bottle and ties it into a bow, causing the decoration to be more appealing and complete.
5) Finally, she uses scissors to trim the ends of the ribbon and lace, which results in a tidy and professional finish.
