1) The video starts with a man in a bathroom, holding a blue and black Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor, which causes him to begin demonstrating the use of the razor.
2) He demonstrates the use of the razor by shaving his beard, focusing on trimming and shaping it, which leads to preparing his skin for a closer shave.
3) Preparing his skin involves applying a facial scrub to his hands and rubbing it onto his face, causing the removal of dead skin cells and providing a smoother surface for shaving.
4) After the scrub, he applies clear shave gel to his hands and rubs it onto his face, which allows the razor to glide smoothly over the skin and minimize irritation.
5) With his skin prepared, he proceeds to shave his beard using the razor, rinsing it under running water after each stroke, which ensures a clean and effective shave.
6) Once the main areas are shaved, he tightens the edges of his beard with the razor, leading to a more defined and polished look.
7) Finally, he moisturizes his skin by applying a product from a tube onto his face, which soothes and hydrates the skin post-shave, concluding the grooming process.
