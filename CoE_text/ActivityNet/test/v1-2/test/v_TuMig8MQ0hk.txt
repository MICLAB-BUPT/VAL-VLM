1) The video captures a male athlete in a yellow top and blue shorts performing a long jump at an outdoor sports event, which causes the setting to be a spacious field with spectators and officials around.
2) The athlete runs down the track, gaining speed as he approaches the takeoff board, which leads to him taking off from the board and propelling himself into the air.
3) He extends his legs forward to maximize distance, which results in him landing smoothly in the sandpit and kicking up a cloud of dust upon impact.
4) The environment is an open field with trees in the background under clear skies, which contributes to ample sunlight casting shadows on the ground.
5) Spectators are dressed in casual attire, some standing while others sit on benches or chairs, and this variety of colors in their clothing creates a vibrant backdrop for the athlete's performance.
6) The sand pit is surrounded by white lines marking the jumping area, where officials stand nearby, observing the jump.
