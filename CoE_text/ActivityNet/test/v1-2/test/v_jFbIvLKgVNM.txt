There seems to be a discrepancy in the provided answers, as they describe two different events: one involving discus throwing and the other hammer throwing. Since these are distinct activities, it's not possible to create a single logical chain that combines both without clarification on which event is intended or if there's an expectation to merge these into a hypothetical scenario. Could you please clarify or specify which event (discus throwing or hammer throwing) you would like to focus on, or if you're looking for a combined hypothetical scenario?
