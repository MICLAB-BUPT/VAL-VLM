1) The video shows a young child, likely a toddler, sitting on the floor and using a nail file to file another person's toenails. This indicates that the child is engaging in an activity that requires some level of concentration and fine motor skills.
2) The child, specifically a young boy wearing a red shirt, is holding a black nail file in his right hand, which causes him to be able to perform the action of filing.
3) The boy is filing the big toe of an adult's foot with the nail file, and the adult's foot is bare and resting on the floor, suggesting that the adult has allowed or asked the child to do this task, which leads to the boy focusing carefully on filing the toenail.
