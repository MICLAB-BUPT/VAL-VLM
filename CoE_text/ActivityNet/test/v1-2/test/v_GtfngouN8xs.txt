1) The video shows a man undergoing a skin test, which causes him to first use a device on his face to measure the oil level.
2) The measurement reveals that one side of his face has a higher oil level than the other, causing the man to cleanse his face using different methods, including a facial cleanser and a sponge.
3) After cleansing, he applies a toner to further clean his face, leading to another measurement of the oil level, which shows a decrease in oiliness.
4) A dermatologist examines the man's skin and explains that one side was cleaned with a facial cleanser and hand, while the other side was cleaned with Konjac Sponge and water, causing a comparison of the skin surface on both sides of the face.
5) The comparison highlights the effectiveness of the Konjac Sponge in cleaning the skin without damaging it, which leads to the conclusion of the video with a demonstration of the Konnyaku Sponge, made of 100% natural plant fiber with water retention capabilities.
