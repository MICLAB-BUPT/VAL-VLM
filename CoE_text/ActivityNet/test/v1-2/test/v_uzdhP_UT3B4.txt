1) The group of young students, who are in a classroom setting, cause the atmosphere to be one of concentration and practice as they engage in playing accordions.
2) The arrangement of chairs in rows causes the students to be seated in an organized manner, which facilitates their focus on the music.
3) The presence of wooden floors and walls, adorned with framed pictures or certificates in one case and posters in another, causes the room to have a warm and educational ambiance.
4) The bright lighting, likely from overhead fluorescent lights, causes the environment to be well-illuminated, enhancing visibility for the students as they play their instruments.
5) The students' attire, whether casual clothing (mostly white tops and dark bottoms) or school uniforms (white shirts, dark skirts or pants, and ties), does not affect their ability to concentrate and play the accordions, indicating that their focus is primarily on the musical activity.
