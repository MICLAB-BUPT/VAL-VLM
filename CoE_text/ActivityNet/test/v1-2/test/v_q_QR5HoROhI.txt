1) The video begins with a title screen displaying the 'nail superstore.com' logo and 'Mosiac Nail' text, setting the stage for a nail art demonstration.
2) A person is then seen sitting at a table, surrounded by various nail products, indicating preparation to perform a detailed nail art process, which causes them to start by applying black nail polish to a fingernail using a brush.
3) After applying the base color, they place the hand under a UV lamp for curing, ensuring the black polish dries and sets properly, which is essential before adding more layers.
4) Once the black base is cured, they apply glittery purple nail polish over it, creating a layered and textured look. This step is repeated several times, enhancing the depth and richness of the design, leading to a visually appealing effect.
5) To further enhance the design, they switch to green glittery polish, adding it in small strokes to create a marbled effect, which adds complexity and uniqueness to the nail art, making the overall appearance more artistic.
6) Finally, to seal and protect the intricate design, they apply a clear top coat over the entire nail, ensuring the longevity and durability of the nail art, which results in a finished and professional look.
7) The video ends with another title screen displaying the 'nail superstore.com' logo and 'Mosiac Nail' text, concluding the demonstration and reinforcing the brand's presence.
