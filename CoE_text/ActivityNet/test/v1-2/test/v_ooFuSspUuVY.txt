1) The girl, dressed in a blue tank top and a pink helmet, is riding a brown and white horse in an outdoor arena.
2) The presence of various obstacles like poles and jumps set up for training causes the girl to demonstrate her equestrian skills by trotting around, jumping over these obstacles, and maintaining control of the horse.
3) A woman in a white shirt and black pants stands nearby, observing the girl's performance, which suggests she is likely there to provide guidance or feedback on the girl's equestrian skills.
4) Another woman, in a blue shirt and black pants, is also present, standing on the opposite side of the frame, watching the girl ride, indicating that both women are there to support or supervise the girl during her practice.
5) The setting, with its wooden fence, green trees, and a house visible in the distance, along with the lighting suggesting early morning or late afternoon, creates a suitable environment for the equestrian practice session.
