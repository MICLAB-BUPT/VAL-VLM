1) The video begins with a black and white dog standing in a bathtub, looking at the camera, which causes a person wearing a gray shirt and blue jeans to be seen kneeling beside the tub, holding a showerhead.
2) The person sprays water on the dog, which causes the dog to shake its head and body to dry off.
3) The scene transitions to a black screen with white text that reads, "The Pet Shower connects easily to your shower through the Shower Connector which you install once and leave in place," which leads to the next scene where the person uses a handheld showerhead to rinse the dog, spraying water over its back and sides.
4) The dog stands still as the person continues to rinse it, which is followed by another black screen with white text stating, "Using the Bath Mitt is an easy way to quickly lather up your dog."
5) The person then uses a yellow bath mitt to lather soap onto the dog's fur, focusing on its back and sides, causing the dog to remain calm and cooperative throughout the process.
6) The thorough coverage of soap on the dog results in the person using a handheld showerhead to rinse the dog again, spraying water over its back and sides.
7) The person holds the dog's head gently while rinsing its face and neck area, which causes the dog to shake its head and body to dry off after being rinsed.
