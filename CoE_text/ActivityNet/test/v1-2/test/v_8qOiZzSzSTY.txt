1) The video begins with a title screen displaying the text "Little Athletics Australia" and "Shot Put Coaching Tips," which causes it to transition to an outdoor setting.
2) In this setting, a woman in a blue and yellow jacket, identified as the instructor, stands on a grassy field, leading to her observing and guiding a young boy dressed in a white shirt and black shorts.
3) The boy is seen preparing for a shot put throw by standing on a concrete circle and holding the shot put close to his neck, which then causes him to perform a series of movements, including swinging his arm back and forth.
4) These preparatory actions build up the necessary momentum, causing the boy to finally release the shot put into the air.
5) Throughout the sequence, from preparation to release, the instructor provides feedback and encouragement, thereby showcasing the technique and form involved in the sport.
