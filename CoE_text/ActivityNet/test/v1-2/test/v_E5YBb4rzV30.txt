1) The video begins with a title card introducing the recipe for Classic Tuna Salad in Lettuce Wraps, featuring the Bumble Bee brand logo, which sets the stage for the cooking demonstration.
2) A woman is shown preparing ingredients on a kitchen counter, including a can of tuna, a bowl of mayonnaise, chopped onions, and lettuce leaves, to ensure all necessary items are ready for use.
3) She starts by mixing ingredients like mayonnaise, relish, and mustard in a bowl, creating the base for the tuna salad, which will add flavor and bind the ingredients together.
4) Chopped onions are then added to the mixture, enhancing the taste and texture of the salad, after which the can of tuna is opened and drained to remove excess liquid, preventing the salad from becoming too watery.
5) The drained tuna is mixed with the previously prepared salad ingredients, integrating all components into a cohesive filling, which causes the flavors to meld and create a balanced taste.
6) The person then places the prepared salad onto lettuce leaves, using them as a natural, low-carb alternative to traditional wraps, and folds them into wraps, assembling the dish in an appealing and easy-to-eat format.
7) Finally, the neatly wrapped lettuce wraps filled with the tuna mixture are arranged on a plate, showcasing the finished product and completing the preparation process, which results in an attractive and appetizing meal.
