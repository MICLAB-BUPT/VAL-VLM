1) The video begins with a close-up of the Cuban sandwich, setting the stage for the preparation process.
2) This is followed by showing the ingredients, which include olive oil, garlic, mustard, cheese, pickles, ham, and bacon, causing the viewer to understand what will be used in making the sandwich.
3) The process starts with spreading mustard on the bread, leading to the addition of cheese, ham, pickles, and bacon, which forms the core content of the sandwich.
4) After assembling the sandwich, it is brushed with either olive oil or melted butter, preparing it for cooking and ensuring a crispy exterior.
5) The sandwich is then cooked, either in a panini press until golden brown or in a skillet where it's toasted and flipped, resulting in a perfectly cooked and visually appealing meal.
6) Finally, the finished sandwich is cut in half (if not already done so during the cooking process) and served alongside a side salad, completing the presentation and readying it for consumption.
