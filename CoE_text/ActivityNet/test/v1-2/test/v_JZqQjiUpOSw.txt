1) The man in a camouflage jacket and cap is kneeling by a pile of rocks, holding a bundle of dry grass and attempting to start a fire.
2) He carefully arranges the grass and other materials within the rock structure, which causes him to create a suitable setting for ignition.
3) The man blows on the arranged materials, which causes smoke to begin emerging from the bundle.
4) As he continues to blow, small flames start to appear, indicating that the fire has been successfully ignited.
5) The appearance of the flames causes the man to adjust the position of the burning materials to ensure they catch properly.
6) The man then adds more twigs and adjusts the arrangement of the rocks, which causes the fire to burn steadily.
