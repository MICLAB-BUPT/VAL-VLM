1) The video showcases a hairstyling tutorial where a stylist, dressed in black, is seen working on a woman's hair.
2) The stylist starts by combing through her hair, which causes the hair to be more manageable and ready for styling.
3) He then proceeds to section it off, which allows him to work on one part of the hair at a time, ensuring each section receives equal attention.
4) The stylist wraps strands of hair around pink and yellow rollers, securing them tightly with clips, which causes the hair to be set in a specific shape for curl formation.
5) The woman, with her hair partially styled, sits patiently while the stylist works, indicating the process requires some time and patience.
6) After all the hair is rolled up, the stylist uses a blow dryer to set the curls in place, causing the hair to hold the desired shape and texture.
7) Finally, he removes the rollers from the woman's hair, revealing bouncy curls, which concludes the styling process.
