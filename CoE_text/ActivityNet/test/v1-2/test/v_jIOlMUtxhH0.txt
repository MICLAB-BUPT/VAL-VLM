1) A woman in a red shirt and black shorts is preparing to lift a barbell with weights on each side, which causes her to approach the barbell.
2) She bends down and grips it with both hands, causing her to lift the barbell off the ground.
3) Lifting the barbell off the ground then leads to her raising it to her shoulders.
4) With the barbell at shoulder height, she squats down while holding it, which after standing up from the squat, causes her to lift the barbell over her head.
5) She holds the barbell above her head for a moment, leading to her lowering it back to the ground.
6) Lowering the barbell back to the ground then results in her stepping back from the barbell.
7) Finally, stepping back from the barbell causes her to celebrate her successful lift, thus completing her lifting sequence.
