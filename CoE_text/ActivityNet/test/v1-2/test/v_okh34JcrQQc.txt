1) The man starts by standing near a barbell loaded with red, green, and yellow weight plates, dressed in a white t-shirt, black pants, and white shoes.
2) He approaches the barbell, adjusts his wrist wraps, and bends down to grip the barbell firmly, which causes him to prepare for the lift.
3) With a focused expression, he lifts the barbell off the ground, transitioning into a squat position while maintaining control of the weight, which allows him to execute the first part of the exercise.
4) After holding the squat for a moment, he stands up, pushing the barbell overhead, which results in completing the second part of the lift.
5) He then lowers the barbell back to the ground and steps away from it, causing the completion of the entire lifting sequence.
