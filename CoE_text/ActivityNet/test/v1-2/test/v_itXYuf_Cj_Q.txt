1) The video starts with a black screen displaying Vietnamese text, causing the introduction of the first scene.
2) This leads to a man sitting in a red chair holding a banana, which causes him to peel the banana and use it to clean his shoe, demonstrating how to use the banana as a cleaning tool for shoes.
3) The demonstration by the first man then causes the scene to transition to another man in a different setting, who also uses a banana to clean his shoe, reinforcing the idea that bananas can be used for this purpose.
4) Following the second man's action, the video cuts back to the first man, who continues cleaning his shoe with the banana, further emphasizing the effectiveness of the method.
5) The continuous demonstration of using bananas to clean shoes then causes text to appear on the screen in Vietnamese, suggesting that the banana is effective for cleaning shoes, thereby validating the actions shown in the video.
6) Finally, the validation of the banana's effectiveness as a shoe cleaner causes the video to end with an advertisement for KIWI shoe care products, showing a group of men in red shirts jumping in water with their shoes on, contrasting the natural solution with a commercial product.
