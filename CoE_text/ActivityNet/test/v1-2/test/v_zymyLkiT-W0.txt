1) The man, wearing a white tank top, is sitting on a chair outdoors, which causes him to be in an environment where he can comfortably smoke a hookah.
2) He has a blue hookah and a table beside him, which allows him to easily access the hookah for smoking.
3) The man inhales from the hookah, which causes large clouds of smoke to be exhaled as a direct result of his action.
4) The background, including a house with windows, siding, and a roof, along with parked cars, suggests that this outdoor setting is likely a residential area, which provides a context for the casual nature of the activity.
