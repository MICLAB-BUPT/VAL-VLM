1) The video begins with a man in a yellow jacket opening the door of a silver pickup truck, causing him to then get into the truck and close the door.
2) After sitting inside for a moment, he opens the door again, which leads to him getting out of the truck while holding a leash attached to a dog.
3) Holding the leash causes the man to start walking the dog around the parking lot, passing by several cars and trees, an action that continues until the end of the video where they are seen walking away from the camera.
