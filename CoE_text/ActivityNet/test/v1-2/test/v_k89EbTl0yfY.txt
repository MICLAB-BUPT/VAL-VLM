1) The video features a female athlete in a white top and black shorts preparing for a pole vault attempt, which causes her to hold a long, flexible pole.
2) She positions herself on the runway, causing her to begin her run-up towards the vaulting area.
3) As she approaches the vaulting box, she plants the pole into the ground, which causes her to use it to propel herself upwards.
4) Using the pole to launch herself, she gracefully arches over the bar, clearing it successfully, which is caused by her skill and the momentum from the run-up.
5) After clearing the bar, she lands safely on her back on the large blue mat with 'UCS' visible on its side, which causes her to complete the jump.
6) Finally, after landing, she gets up and walks away from the vaulting area, which signifies the end of her attempt.
