1) The video begins with a close-up of a woman's eye, showcasing her makeup, which causes the scene to transition to a makeup palette with various shades of eyeshadow.
2) This setup leads to a brush being used to apply the eyeshadow to the eyelid, and then an eyeliner pencil is applied along the upper lash line, creating a winged effect at the outer corner.
3) Following the application of eyeliner, the person uses an eyeshadow brush to apply a light-colored eyeshadow on the inner corner of the eye and blend it towards the crease, which is then followed by applying a darker eyeshadow on the outer corner of the eye, blending it smoothly with the previous shade.
4) These steps cause the person to finally use a mascara wand to coat the eyelashes, giving them volume and length, leading to the conclusion of the video with the woman's fully made-up eye, highlighting the completed look.
