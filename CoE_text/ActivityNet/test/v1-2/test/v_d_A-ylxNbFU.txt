1) The video shows a man holding a bottle of beer in his hand, which causes him to bring the bottle close to the lens and display the brand name 'Budweiser'.
2) After displaying the beer, the man takes a drink from the bottle, tilting his head back as he does so, which leads to him lowering the bottle.
3) Lowering the bottle then results in him continuing to look at the camera.
