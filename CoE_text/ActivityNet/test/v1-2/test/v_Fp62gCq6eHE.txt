1) The video begins with a group of people in white and green jackets cheering enthusiastically, which causes the scene to shift to an outdoor sports field.
2) On the sports field, a man in a white tank top and red shorts is preparing for a shot put event, causing him to stand in a circular area, holding the shot put ball close to his neck.
3) He starts by bending down slightly, then swings the ball back and forth, which causes him to launch it into the air with a powerful motion after spinning to gain momentum.
4) The camera follows the ball's trajectory as it flies through the sky, which causes the man to walk out of the circular area, watching the ball's flight path.
