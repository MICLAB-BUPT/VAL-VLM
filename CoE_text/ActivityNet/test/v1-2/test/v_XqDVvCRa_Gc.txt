1) The video begins with a title card stating 'Did not tape 1st attempt' on a white background, which causes the viewer to understand that the initial attempt of the javelin throw was not recorded.
2) It then cuts to a scene of an athlete preparing for a javelin throw, standing behind a marked line with a coach nearby, which leads to the athlete, dressed in a white top and pink shorts, holding a yellow javelin, taking her stance and winding up.
3) The athlete throws the javelin, causing the camera to follow the javelin's flight path as it lands in the distance, and this action prompts a man in a white shirt and black pants to retrieve the javelin from the field.
4) The scene shifts back to the athlete, now standing with other athletes and coaches, observing the throw, which indicates that they are evaluating the performance.
5) The athlete prepares for another throw, repeating the process of winding up and releasing the javelin, which results in the final frame showing the word 'FOUL' in bold letters against a white background, indicating that the throw was invalid.
