1) The man, dressed in a blue and white uniform, is standing on a circular platform, which is surrounded by a net, holding a discus in his right hand.
2) He begins to spin around multiple times, building momentum, which causes the discus to gain the necessary speed for a powerful throw.
3) After reaching an adequate velocity, he releases the discus into the air, causing it to fly through the air and land outside of the frame.
4) Once the discus is released, the man stops spinning and watches the discus fly, indicating that his action of throwing has caused the discus to travel.
