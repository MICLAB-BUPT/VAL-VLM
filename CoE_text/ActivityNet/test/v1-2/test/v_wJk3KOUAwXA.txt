1) The man in the workshop, wearing a white apron and blue gloves, starts by sanding the wooden table with an electric sander, which causes the old finish and rough spots to be removed, preparing the surface for refinishing.
2) After sanding, he applies a liquid finish from a can onto the table's surface, using his gloved hand to spread it evenly, which causes the wood to absorb the finish and begin the process of sealing and protecting the table.
3) He then uses a cloth to wipe the table clean, ensuring that the finish is smooth and even, which leads to a more professional and polished look as the finish dries.
4) Finally, he polishes the table with a cloth, sometimes assisted by an electric buffer, which results in a shiny and well-protected surface, completing the refinishing process.
