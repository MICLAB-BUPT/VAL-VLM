1) The video begins with a woman standing against a plain background, wearing a green top. She holds up a pair of white Skechers Go Walk slip-on shoes and shows them to the camera.
2) This is followed by her placing one of the shoes inside a washing machine drum, causing the shoe to be cleaned in the machine.
3) Next, she is seen scrubbing the shoe with a brush in a bathtub filled with water, which further cleans the shoe.
4) She then rinses the shoe under running water, removing any remaining dirt or soap, and repeats the cleaning process for the other shoe.
5) After both shoes are cleaned, she lays them out on a towel to dry, allowing any residual moisture to evaporate.
6) Finally, she wears the cleaned shoes and walks outside on a paved surface, demonstrating their comfort, fit, and the successful completion of the cleaning process, including showcasing the sole design.
