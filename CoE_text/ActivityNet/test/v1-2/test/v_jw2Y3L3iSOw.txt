1) The video showcases a person practicing hammer throw inside a neted area, where the individual is dressed in a blue jacket and black pants.
2) The person begins to swing the hammer around their body, which causes them to gradually increase the speed of the rotation to gain momentum.
3) After several rotations, the increased momentum causes the person to release the hammer, and it flies out of the netted area.
4) Following the release, the person stops swinging and watches the hammer's trajectory, which is the result of the momentum generated from the swinging.
