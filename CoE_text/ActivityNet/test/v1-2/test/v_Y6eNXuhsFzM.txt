2) The child, wearing a black shirt with the number '4', dribbles a basketball and attempts to make shots into the hoop, causing him to run back and forth across the court while demonstrating focus and determination.
3) Other children are seen playing and practicing their own basketball skills in the background, indicating that the court is being used by multiple individuals for similar purposes.
4) A person sitting on a chair near the hoop observes the activity, suggesting a supervisory or coaching role, which provides guidance and possibly feedback to the players.
