1) The video begins with a man standing in a grassy field, wearing a gray cap, a black vest, and a gray tank top, and he is holding a bow and arrow.
2) The man aims at a target that is off-screen, which causes him to pull back the arrow, take aim, and then release it towards the target.
3) After releasing the arrow, it flies through the air towards the target, and the camera follows its trajectory, leading to the arrow hitting the target where several other arrows are already embedded.
4) Post shooting, the man lowers his bow and looks around, possibly checking for any missed shots or observing the surroundings, which leads to him walking over to the target to retrieve his arrows.
5) Retrieving the arrows from the target causes the man to walk back to his starting position, where he repeats the process of aiming and shooting.
