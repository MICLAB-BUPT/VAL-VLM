1) In a spacious, well-lit room with white walls and a black floor, a woman in a red t-shirt and black shorts is practicing boxing with a man wearing a gray hoodie and jeans.
2) The woman wears red boxing gloves and performs a series of punches and kicks towards the focus mitts held by the man, who holds the pads steady to provide resistance for her training.
3) As they practice, the bright lighting overhead casts soft shadows on the dark floor, and the environment, which appears to be an indoor gym or studio, has minimal equipment visible except for a ballet barre against the wall.
