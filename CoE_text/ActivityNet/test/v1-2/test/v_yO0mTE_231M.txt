1) The scene takes place indoors, likely in a living room or similar space.
2) A person is seated on a chair with a red cushion, wearing a dark t-shirt and jeans, which causes the setting to be established with the individual's position and attire.
3) In front of the person, there is a hookah with a metallic base and a glass top filled with water, leading to the availability of the smoking device for use.
4) The individual inhales from the hookah's hose, which is red, causing smoke to be drawn into their lungs.
5) After inhaling, the person exhales the smoke, resulting in a thick cloud that fills the air around him.
6) The environment appears to be dimly lit, possibly by artificial light sources, contributing to a hazy atmosphere as the smoke disperses.
7) The walls are plain, and there's a window behind the person, suggesting it might be evening or night outside, which adds to the overall ambiance of the scene.
