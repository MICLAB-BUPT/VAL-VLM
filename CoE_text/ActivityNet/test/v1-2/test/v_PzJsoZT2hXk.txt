1) The video begins with a woman holding a gift wrapped in colorful paper, which then transitions to two women standing and conversing.
2) The conversation causes the scene to shift to a store where the women are looking at floral arrangements, followed by them sitting at a table with crafting supplies.
3) This setup leads to the demonstration of wrapping a gift using leopard print paper, where one of the women starts by placing the gift on a table.
4) She carefully folds and aligns the paper around the box, causing the need for securing it with tape.
5) After securing the paper, she adds finishing touches like a card and decorative elements, while providing step-by-step instructions and tips for achieving a professional-looking wrapped gift.
6) The detailed demonstration results in showing how to place a card inside the gift bag as well.
7) The completion of the gift-wrapping tutorial causes the video to end with a webpage displaying 'Flomo 2013' and contact information for the brand.
