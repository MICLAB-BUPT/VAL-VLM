1) The video features a woman in a bedroom setting, demonstrating how to curl hair using a hair styling tool.
2) She starts by showing her long, dark hair and then proceeds to section it off, which causes her to be able to manage the hair more effectively for styling.
3) The woman uses a blue cylindrical curling device on her hair, twisting sections of hair around the device, causing each section to form into a curl.
4) She applies a purple hair product to her hair while it's still in the curling device, which helps to set and define the curls.
5) After removing the devices, she reveals defined curls and sprays hairspray onto her hair for hold, causing the style to last longer.
6) Throughout the video, she showcases different stages of the hair styling process, including the use of a red hair straightener to further style her hair, leading to a polished final look. 
7) Alternatively, after sectioning her hair, she applies rollers to each section and carefully rolls her hair around the tool, ensuring each strand is tightly wrapped, which prepares the hair for setting.
8) She then uses a hairdryer to set the curls, causing the hair to maintain the shape from the rollers.
9) Finally, she removes the rollers, revealing beautifully curled hair, which is the result of the entire styling process.
