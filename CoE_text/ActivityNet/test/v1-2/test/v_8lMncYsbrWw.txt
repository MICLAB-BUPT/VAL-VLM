1) The person places the black t-shirt with white text on the ironing board, which is the initial step to start ironing.
2) They smooth out the t-shirt with their hands to prepare it for ironing, causing the fabric to be more even and easier to press.
3) The person then uses a blue iron to press the fabric, moving it back and forth across the shirt, which causes the wrinkles in the shirt to be smoothed out.
4) After ironing one side, they flip the shirt over, causing the other side to now be accessible for ironing.
5) They repeat the process of smoothing and pressing on the other side, ensuring that both sides of the t-shirt are properly pressed.
6) Throughout the ironing process, the person carefully adjusts the t-shirt, which ensures all areas, including those with white text, are properly pressed.
