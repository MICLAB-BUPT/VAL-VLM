1) The woman is washing dishes outdoors, which causes her to be surrounded by several large metal basins filled with water and various dishes, including plates and bowls.
2) Because she is squatting on the ground, she uses a blue bowl to scoop water from a large metal basin, and then uses her hands to scrub the dishes placed in another metal basin nearby.
3) The environment being an outdoor area, possibly a courtyard or a backyard, with a concrete floor and walls visible in the background, causes the woman to adapt her dishwashing method by using basins and her hands instead of a conventional sink.
