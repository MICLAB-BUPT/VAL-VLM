2) A young boy in a red leotard, which stands out against the blue mats and neutral tones of the walls and floor, is being assisted by an adult male coach wearing a black shirt and dark pants.
3) The coach guides the boy through a series of movements on the parallel bars, including swinging his legs over them and performing a handstand, causing the boy to attempt a gymnastic move.
4) The boy struggles to maintain his balance during the attempt, leading the instructor to guide him off the bars and onto a mat for safety.
