1) The video begins with a man in a yellow shirt standing in front of a bathroom mirror, holding an electric razor, which causes him to start shaving his beard while looking into the mirror.
2) A woman and a child are visible in the background, watching him, causing the woman to be recording or taking pictures of the man while he shaves and the child to be playing with a toy near the Christmas tree.
3) The man continues to shave, occasionally glancing at the camera, which leads to him eventually finishing his shave, turning off the razor, and looking at himself in the mirror.
4) The woman then enters the bathroom, wearing a black hat with cat ears, which prompts her to take a picture of the man with her phone.
5) This action by the woman causes the man to pick up a small child from the floor and hold her in his arms.
6) As a result, the woman continues to take pictures of them both, leading the man and the child to pose for a few moments before the video ends.
