1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'eHow' in green letters on a white background, followed by the word 'style' in white letters on a maroon background.
2) This causes the scene to transition to two women sitting side by side; one is wearing a shiny blue top and a necklace, while the other is dressed in a white robe with 'eHow' printed on it. They are seated in front of a vanity mirror with lights and flowers in the background.
3) The woman in the blue top begins speaking, gesturing with her hands, which leads to the focus shifting to a close-up of a table where a green bowl with a spoon and a box of Arm & Hammer Pure Baking Soda are placed.
4) As a result, the woman in the blue top picks up the baking soda box, opens it, revealing a measuring spoon inside, and pours some baking soda into the bowl.
5) Consequently, she demonstrates how to use the baking soda mixture on her face, applying it with her hands, and then wipes her face with a towel.
6) This demonstration prompts the woman in the robe to take over, applying the mixture to her own face using a white cloth.
7) Throughout the demonstration, both women continue to speak and gesture, likely explaining the skincare process, which ultimately concludes with the same maroon background displaying 'eHow' in green letters and the word 'style' in white letters, followed by a black screen with white text that reads 'video filmed by John Wilbers.'
