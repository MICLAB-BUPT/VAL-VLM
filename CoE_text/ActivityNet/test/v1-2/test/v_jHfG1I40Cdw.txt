1) A woman in a green top is standing at a kitchen counter, preparing to make a sandwich.
2) She takes out a loaf of bread from a bag and places it on the counter, causing her to have access to the bread slices needed for the sandwich.
3) The woman then takes out a jar of mayonnaise and opens it, which allows her to spread mayonnaise on two slices of bread using a knife, adding flavor and moisture to the sandwich.
4) Next, she takes cheese slices out and places them on one of the slices of bread, leading to an increase in the sandwich's taste and texture.
5) After that, she adds another slice of cheese on top of the first one, further enhancing the richness and flavor of the sandwich.
6) Then, she takes a slice of ham from a package and places it on the cheese-covered slice of bread, contributing to the protein content and overall heartiness of the sandwich.
7) Finally, she puts the other slice of bread on top, completing the assembly of the sandwich.
