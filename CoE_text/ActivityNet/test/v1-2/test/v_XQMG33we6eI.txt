1) The man is in a kitchen setting, standing behind an ironing board with a green shirt laid out on it, and he is wearing a light green shirt and dark pants.
2) He begins by folding the shirt neatly, which causes him to be ready to start ironing.
3) He then uses a white iron to press the shirt, moving the iron back and forth across the fabric, which results in the shirt becoming smooth and wrinkle-free.
4) After ironing, he inspects the shirt by lifting it up, which allows him to check for any remaining wrinkles.
5) Upon finding no wrinkles, he folds the shirt again, ensuring it's properly aligned and compact, which leads to the completion of his task.
6) Throughout the process, his focused and meticulous behavior demonstrates a methodical approach to ironing.
