1) The video begins with a black screen displaying white text that reads, "Unlike most countries, cigarettes are sold loose in India," which causes the next black screen to appear, showing the text, "And so all cigarette shops have electric lighters fitted for smokers."
2) This context leads to the scene of a man in a white shirt lighting a cigarette using an electric lighter at a shop, and subsequently, another older man with white hair is shown doing the same.
3) The video then transitions to a black screen with the text, "We thought what if we used the lighter itself as the medium... to ask the smoker to quit smoking," which introduces the idea of turning the regular lighter into a chanting lighter, causing the scenes of people lighting cigarettes using these modified electric lighters to be shown.
4) As a result, when a man in a yellow shirt lights a cigarette, the lighter plays a chant, which is traditionally sung when someone dies in India. This action is designed to discourage smoking by associating it with death, leading to the display of the Cancer Patients Aid Association's logo and information at the end of the video, promoting their cause.
