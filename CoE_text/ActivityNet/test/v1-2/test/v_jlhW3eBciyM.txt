1) The video begins with a close-up of a black and white checkered floor, transitioning to a tattoo artist's workspace, which causes the setting to be established as a professional tattoo studio.
2) The tattoo artist, wearing gloves, is seen working on a client's arm, which already has an existing tattoo, indicating that the process of adding or modifying a tattoo is about to take place.
3) The artist uses a tattoo machine to add details to the client's arm, focusing on the area around the elbow, which leads to the application of ink to the skin.

5) The person getting the tattoo is sitting in a chair, and the tattoo artist is standing next to them, causing the dynamic of the tattoo session where the artist can easily access and work on the designated area.
