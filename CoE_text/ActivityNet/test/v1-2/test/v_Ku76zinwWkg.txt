1) The video features an outdoor track and field event, specifically a long jump competition, which causes the environment to be a well-maintained sports field with a red running track and a sandpit for the jumps.
2) The presence of spectators and athletes scattered around the area, some standing while others are seated on the grass or benches, indicates that the environment is lively with people engaged in various activities related to the sports event.
3) The sky being partly cloudy suggests it might be late afternoon, causing the vibrant colors of the green grass, colorful buildings in the background, and the red of the track to contrast against the athletes' attire.
4) Athletes taking turns sprinting down the track towards the sandpit, attempting to leap as far as possible, leads to one athlete in particular, wearing black sportswear, being shown in multiple attempts.
5) The measurements displayed on screen indicating distances of 16.09m and 16.25m are a result of the male athlete's fluid and focused movements as he prepares for each jump, runs towards the sandpit, takes off from the runway, and lands in the sand.
