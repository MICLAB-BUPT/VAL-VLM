2) This introduction causes the scene to transition to a woman in an airport setting, wearing a purple uniform with gold accents and holding pink flowers.
3) The focus shifting to her face leads to her starting the makeup application with foundation, blending it evenly across her cheeks and forehead.
4) After the foundation is applied, she uses a brush to apply blush on her cheeks, which adds color to her complexion.
5) The application of blush then causes her to move on to applying eyeshadow to her eyelids, creating a gradient effect with different shades.
6) Once the eyeshadow is applied, she proceeds to use a brush to apply eyeliner along her upper lash line, defining her eyes.
7) The eyeliner application is followed by the use of mascara to enhance her eyelashes, increasing their volume and length.
8) To achieve a more dramatic effect, she carefully places false eyelashes onto her eyelid after the mascara has been applied.
9) She then applies more eyeshadow around her eyes, blending it smoothly, to ensure both sides are symmetrical.
