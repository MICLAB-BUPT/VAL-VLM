3) After standing up straight from the squat, he then pushes the barbell overhead, successfully completing the lift.
4) The background features banners and signs, including one that reads 'ELEIKO' and another that says 'SELLING OHIO SINCE 1953', and there's also a digital timer displaying '195.0' and '0:11', indicating the weight and time taken for the lift.
5) Upon completion of the lift, he drops the barbell back onto the platform and raises his arms in victory.
