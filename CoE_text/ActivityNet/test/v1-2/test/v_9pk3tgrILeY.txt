1) The video depicts a young man in a kitchen setting, where he begins by pouring a dark liquid from a bottle into a glass, which is a mixture of coffee grounds, milk, and soda.
2) He then adds milk to the glass and stirs it with a spoon, causing the ingredients to mix together.
3) The young man drinks the mixture directly from the glass, tilting his head back, but this action causes him to react with discomfort.
4) Due to the discomfort, he leans over the sink, possibly to rinse his mouth or spit out the contents of the glass.
