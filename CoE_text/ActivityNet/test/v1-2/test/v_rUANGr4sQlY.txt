1) The woman in a green shirt begins by turning on the faucet and filling the sink with water, which causes the sink to be ready for washing dishes.
2) She then uses a sponge to clean a red bowl, which causes the bowl to become free of any dirt or food residue.
3) After scrubbing, she rinses the red bowl under the running water, causing the bowl to be thoroughly cleaned.
4) Next, she washes a white mug with floral designs, scrubbing it thoroughly, which leads to the mug also being free of dirt or food residue.
5) She rinses the mug again under the running water, ensuring that it is fully cleaned.
6) After cleaning both items, she places them on a drying rack beside the sink, allowing them to air dry, but in another instance, she dries the dishes with a towel, which results in the immediate drying of the dishes.
7) The kitchen, equipped with white cabinets, a stainless steel sink, and various kitchen items like a coffee maker, paper towel roll, and dish soap bottle, provides the necessary environment and tools for her to complete the dishwashing process.
