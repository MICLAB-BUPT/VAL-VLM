1) The woman, dressed in a purple tank top, black shorts, and white sneakers, holds the javelin above her head with both hands, which is the starting position for her throw.
2) She then runs forward while maintaining her grip on the javelin, causing her to build up momentum necessary for an effective throw.
3) As she approaches the throwing line, the built-up momentum from running causes her to transition into a throwing motion, extending her arm to release the javelin.
4) The fluid and focused movements during the run and throw cause the javelin to be released into the air with force and direction.
5) After releasing the javelin, she comes to a stop and watches its trajectory, allowing her to observe the result of her throw.
