1) The video starts with a woman in a salon setting, wearing a teal top and having her hair styled by another woman, identified as Abigail de Casanova.
2) The stylist, Abigail, begins by brushing the client's hair, which causes the hair to become smooth and manageable.

4) Abigail then gathers the client's hair and ties it into a low ponytail, securing it with a hair tie, which creates a neat and polished look.
5) To ensure the style is perfect, Abigail adjusts the ponytail, making sure it sits correctly at the back of the woman's head, which enhances the overall appearance.
6) The environment, including salon chairs, mirrors, and various hair products, along with the bright lighting, supports the professional atmosphere of the session.
