1) In a well-lit gym with red and black mats, two individuals are engaged in a martial arts training session.
2) The person wearing a white shirt and black shorts is blindfolded with a green cloth, while the other, in a black sleeveless top and shorts, wears protective gear including shin guards and gloves, and holds a padded shield.
3) The bright lighting, likely from overhead fluorescent lights, illuminates the entire space evenly, causing minimal shadows on the floor.
4) The presence of gym equipment like punching bags and weights in the background indicates that the setting is designed for comprehensive physical training.
5) The blindfolded individual throws punches and kicks at the instructor who holds up pads to receive them, which causes the focus to be on the interaction between the two individuals as they execute their training drills.
