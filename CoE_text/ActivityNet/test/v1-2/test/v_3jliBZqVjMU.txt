1) The video starts with a title card introducing the tutorial on removing wrinkles from polyester clothing, which causes the man in a suit to be shown holding up a wrinkled shirt, indicating the problem.
2) This introduction then leads to a list of items needed for the process: polyester fabric, pressing cloth, iron, and optionally, a clothing steamer, preparing the viewer for the steps that will follow.
3) The man demonstrates ironing the shirt using a pressing cloth over it, which is followed by him spraying the shirt with water before ironing, causing the wrinkles to become more susceptible to being smoothed out.
4) After ironing, he hangs the shirt over a clothes steamer to steam out the remaining wrinkles, further contributing to the overall goal of achieving wrinkle-free clothing.
5) The man then loads the shirt into a washing machine, presumably to remove any remaining wrinkles, and sets the dryer to a low heat cycle, which helps in maintaining the fabric's integrity while still working towards removing wrinkles.
6) Finally, he takes the shirt out of the dryer and hangs it to dry, completing the series of actions aimed at removing wrinkles from polyester clothing.
