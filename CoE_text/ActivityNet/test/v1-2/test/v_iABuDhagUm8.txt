1) A man in a gray t-shirt and khaki shorts is standing in a backyard with green grass, trees, and a wooden fence, holding an axe and preparing to chop wood on a tree stump. The sky is partly cloudy with blue skies visible, and there are toys scattered around the yard, including a blue ball and a toy truck.
2) The presence of the large tree stump and the man's action of holding the axe cause him to prepare for chopping the wood.
3) The man swings the axe down onto the stump multiple times, attempting to split the wood, which leads to the successful splitting of the stump into pieces.
4) After successfully splitting the stump, his action causes him to raise his arms in celebration, indicating the completion of the task.
