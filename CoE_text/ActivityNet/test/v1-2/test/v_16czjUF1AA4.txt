3) After clearing the bar, she lands on the mat, which causes her to celebrate her successful jump. 
4) The environment appears to be an outdoor stadium during daylight with clear skies, causing the colors in the scene to be vibrant, with the green of the grass contrasting against the red track and the blue sky.
