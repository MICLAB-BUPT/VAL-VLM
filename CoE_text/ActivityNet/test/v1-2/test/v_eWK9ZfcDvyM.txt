1) The video features a person, specifically a woman in a grey blazer, demonstrating the proper handwashing technique in a bathroom setting.
2) She turns on the faucet, which causes water to flow, and she wets her hands under the running water.
3) After wetting her hands, she dispenses soap from a white soap dispenser mounted on the wall, causing her to have soap to use for washing.
4) With the soap, she rubs her hands together thoroughly to create a lather, ensuring all areas are covered, which is done to effectively clean her hands.
5) She continues to scrub for several seconds, which causes the soap to work against any dirt or germs on her hands.
6) Next, she rinses her hands under the running water, making sure to clean off all the soap, which removes the soap and any dirt or germs that were loosened during the lathering process.
7) Finally, she dries her hands using a paper towel from a dispenser mounted on the wall, which completes the handwashing process by removing any remaining moisture.
