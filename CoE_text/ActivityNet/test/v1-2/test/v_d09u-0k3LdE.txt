1) The woman, dressed in a black tank top and shorts, is practicing hammer throw in an outdoor sports field, which is surrounded by a net, trees, buildings, and under a cloudy sky.
2) To start the practice, she holds the hammer with both hands and begins swinging it around her body, causing her to also rotate her body along with the hammer to build up speed and power.
3) After several rotations, the momentum and power she has generated cause her to release the hammer, sending it flying through the air.
4) The release of the hammer causes it to land outside the netted area, completing the action of the hammer throw.
