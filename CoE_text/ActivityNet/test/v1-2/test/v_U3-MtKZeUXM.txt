1) The video shows a man in a blue and red uniform practicing hammer throw inside a netted area.
2) He starts by standing still, then begins to swing the hammer around his body, gradually increasing the speed of the rotation, which causes the momentum of the hammer to build up.
3) The man is focused on his technique, ensuring that he maintains control of the hammer throughout the exercise, but eventually, he releases the hammer.
4) The release of the hammer, due to the built-up momentum, causes it to fly through the air.
5) Despite the presence of the netting, which serves as a safety measure to prevent the hammer from flying out, the hammer lands outside the netted area.
