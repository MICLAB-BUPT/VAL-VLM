1) The video shows a man in a red shirt and black shorts standing inside a fenced-in area with a net.
2) He is holding a hammer throw ball, which he begins to swing around his body, gradually increasing the speed of the rotation.
3) The increase in speed causes the man to prepare for the release.
4) The man then releases the ball, which flies through the air as a result of the momentum built up during the swinging.
5) The release of the ball causes it to travel through the air and land outside the fenced area.
