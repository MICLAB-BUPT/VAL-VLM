1) A healthcare professional, likely a nurse or doctor, is in a clinical environment, possibly a hospital or clinic room, to perform a medical procedure on a patient's leg, which causes the professional to prepare and set up the necessary medical equipment and supplies.
2) The healthcare professional, wearing blue scrubs and having a name tag, approaches the patient, who is lying down on an examination table with their leg exposed, leading to the professional covering the patient's leg with a blue sterile drape for maintaining a sterile field.
3) The professional then uses a purple medical device or instrument, causing the application of a substance to the patient's leg, which is part of the treatment or medication process.
