1) A woman, wearing a black jacket and a skirt (red or blue), is standing in front of a water fountain.
2) The presence of the water fountain and the wooden ladle causes her to use these tools for washing her hands.
3) Her action of scooping water with the ladle and pouring it over her hands leads to her washing them thoroughly, ensuring all areas are covered with water.
