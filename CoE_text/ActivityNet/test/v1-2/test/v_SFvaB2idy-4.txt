1) The video features two women in a room with a painting and decorative plants, setting the scene for a makeup tutorial.
2) One woman, wearing a black top, is seated, while the other, in a black shirt, stands beside her holding a tube of Colgate toothpaste, indicating the start of the demonstration.
3) The standing woman, presumably Erin Hendley, applies the toothpaste to the seated woman's face using a blue brush, causing the seated woman to have toothpaste on her face as part of the process.
4) She then uses a white cloth to wipe off the toothpaste, leading to the removal of the initial application.
5) After wiping the toothpaste, she picks up a bottle of lotion and sprays it onto the cloth, preparing for the next step in the routine.
6) Using the lotion-moistened cloth, she wipes the seated woman's face again, resulting in the application of the lotion.
7) Throughout the video, the standing woman explains the process while demonstrating each step, ensuring that the audience understands the techniques being used.
8) The tutorial progresses with the application of makeup to the seated woman's face using a white bottle and a blue applicator, focusing on the detailed application, particularly around the eyes, to achieve even coverage.
