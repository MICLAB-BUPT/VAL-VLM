1) The video shows a man cleaning a window, and he is wearing a dark long-sleeve shirt and light blue jeans.
2) The man is kneeling in front of the window, which has a white frame and is set into a brick wall, and there are various cleaning supplies on the windowsill, including a spray bottle with a red nozzle, a white cloth, and a purple cloth (in one description, a green cloth).
3) The man starts by spraying the window with the cleaning solution from the spray bottle, which is labeled 'Windex', causing the window to be covered with the cleaning fluid.
4) He then uses the white cloth to wipe the window in circular motions, which causes the cleaning solution to spread evenly and start removing dirt and grime.
5) After wiping the window with the white cloth, he switches to using another cloth (purple or green), continuing to wipe the window, which further cleans and polishes the surface.
6) The man repeats this sequence of spraying and wiping multiple times, focusing on different sections of the window, which ensures that the entire window is thoroughly cleaned.
