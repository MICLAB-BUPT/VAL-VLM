2) She then proceeds to fold the paper around it, ensuring that it covers the entire surface of the box, which causes the box to be fully covered with either pink or red paper.
3) After folding the paper, she cuts the paper to size if necessary and uses tape to secure it in place, causing the paper to stay firmly wrapped around the box.
4) She adds a ribbon to the top of the box as a finishing touch, tying it in a bow, which enhances the appearance of the gift.
