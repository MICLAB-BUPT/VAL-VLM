1) The video takes place inside a subway train with passengers seated and standing, causing the environment to be crowded and noisy.
2) A man in a black jacket is seen leaning against the wall, holding onto a pole for support, which is due to him appearing to be intoxicated, swaying and moving erratically, struggling to maintain his balance.

4) The man's movements, initially interpreted as erratic and unbalanced, are also described as dancing or moving rhythmically to music, swaying his body and moving his arms, suggesting that his behavior could be influenced by both intoxication and an attempt to dance.
