1) A person is practicing tennis on a court during twilight, which causes the environment to be an outdoor tennis court surrounded by a fence, with trees visible in the background and the sky having a gradient from blue to purple hues.
2) The player, who is wearing a white t-shirt, black shorts, and sneakers, serves the ball with a forehand motion, causing the ball to go over the net to the other side of the court.
3) After serving, the player retrieves the ball to serve again, which results in him continuing to hit the ball back and forth across the net.
