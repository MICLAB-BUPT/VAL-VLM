1) The video begins with a man in a blue jacket and black cap opening a black suitcase containing a saxophone. 
2) He takes out the saxophone, which causes him to put on a black cap with 'OYOYANT' written on it, and start playing the instrument.
3) This action of starting to play the saxophone leads to the scene transitioning to him walking down a covered walkway while playing, then standing outside a building labeled 'SUCASA CLUB' continuing his performance.
4) His continuous playing causes him to move to different locations, including near a restaurant entrance, an empty theater, and in front of a building with a sign reading 'TANDEM'.
5) The man's desire to reach a wider audience or find new spots for his performance causes him to move to a busy street where he plays for passersby.
6) Finally, his exploration of various settings to play music leads to the conclusion of the video, with the man playing in shallow water near a riverbank, with a boat passing by in the background.
