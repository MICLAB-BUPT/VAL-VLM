1) The man in a white t-shirt and black shorts is inside a fenced area with a concrete circle, preparing to perform a hammer throw.
2) He starts by holding the hammer, a metal ball attached to a wire with a grip, with both hands, which causes him to begin swinging it around his body in a circular motion.
3) As he swings the hammer, he gains momentum, causing him to spin faster and faster, rotating multiple times to build up force.
4) The built-up force from the spinning causes him to release the hammer into the air at the right moment.
5) The release of the hammer causes it to fly through the air, eventually landing on the field.
