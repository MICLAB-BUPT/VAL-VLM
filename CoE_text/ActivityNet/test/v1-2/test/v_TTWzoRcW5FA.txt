1) The video features a young woman with long, dark hair in a bathroom setting, initially with wet hair.
2) She starts by brushing her hair, which causes the tangles to be removed and prepares it for styling.
3) Then, she proceeds to section it off and applies a product from a bottle, causing the hair to be treated and ready for manipulation.
4) The woman meticulously twists sections of her hair and secures them with clips, causing each section to hold its shape while the product sets.
5) After twisting all the sections, she waits for three hours, allowing enough time for the product to work and set the curls.
6) Upon untying the twists and removing the clips, her hair appears significantly more voluminous and curly compared to its initial state, as the twisting and product have caused the hair to curl.
7) Finally, she showcases the final look of her styled hair, completing the hair-styling process.
