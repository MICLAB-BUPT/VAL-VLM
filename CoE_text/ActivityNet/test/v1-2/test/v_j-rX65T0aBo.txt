1) The person approaches the sink to wash their hands, which causes them to turn on the faucet with their right hand.
2) Turning on the faucet causes water to flow, and the person wets their hands under the running water.
3) After wetting their hands, the person applies soap, causing them to rub their hands together thoroughly to ensure all areas are covered with soap.
4) Rubbing their hands together with soap for a few seconds causes the soap to lather and clean their hands.
5) Once the hands are sufficiently lathered and cleaned, the person rinses off the soap under the running water, causing the soap to be washed away.
6) With the soap fully rinsed off, the person turns off the faucet, stopping the flow of water.
7) Finally, turning off the faucet causes the person to reach for a towel, which they use to dry their hands.
