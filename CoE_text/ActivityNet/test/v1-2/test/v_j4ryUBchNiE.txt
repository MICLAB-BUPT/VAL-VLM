1) The man in the red shirt and blue jeans, standing in a wooded area surrounded by camping gear, is holding an axe, indicating his intention to chop wood.
2) This intention causes him to raise the axe above his head and bring it down forcefully onto a piece of wood on a tree stump, resulting in the wood being split into smaller pieces.
3) After successfully chopping the wood, he bends down to pick up another piece from the pile, which is a direct action to continue the process of preparing firewood for a campfire.
4) Throughout this process, the woman in a black jacket and the man in a gray shirt are present, with the woman holding something in her hand and the man in the gray shirt watching intently, suggesting that their presence and attention are caused by the man's activity of chopping wood.
