1) The woman in the video is demonstrating how to wrap a gift, which causes her to start by holding a small brown box.
2) She then picks up a roll of wrapping paper, which leads to her unrolling the paper over the box.
3) As she folds the paper neatly around the box and secures it with tape, this action results in the need to cut the excess paper off with scissors.
4) After cutting the excess paper, she smooths out any wrinkles, which ensures that the gift looks neat and well-presented.
5) To complete the demonstration, she adds a ribbon to the top of the wrapped box, causing the final touch that enhances the appearance of the gift.
