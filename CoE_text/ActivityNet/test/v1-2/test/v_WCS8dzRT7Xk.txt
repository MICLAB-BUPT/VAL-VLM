1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'Expert Village Presents' in blue and white, which causes the introduction of the scene where a woman is preparing to demonstrate an ironing process.
2) A woman stands behind an ironing board, holding a green patterned fabric, which leads to her unfolding the fabric, revealing its full length, and placing it on the ironing board.
3) She lays out a white cloth over the fabric and smooths it out, causing the preparation for ironing to be completed.
4) Picking up a silver iron, she begins to iron the white cloth, moving the iron back and forth across the fabric, which results in the fabric being smoothed out.
5) She adjusts the cloth occasionally to ensure even ironing, leading to a thorough and careful pressing of the fabric.
6) After finishing the ironing, she lifts the cloth to reveal the now smooth fabric underneath, which causes the demonstration of the successful ironing result.
7) Finally, she folds the green fabric neatly and holds it up for display, concluding the demonstration by showcasing the properly ironed fabric.
