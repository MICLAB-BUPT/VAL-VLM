1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'Exotic Cocktails in Seconds' and transitions to a bar setting.
2) This transition causes the bartender, dressed in a red shirt, to be shown standing behind the bar counter filled with various bottles of alcohol and bar tools.
3) The bartender begins by pouring a dark liquid from a bottle into a glass, which is then followed by adding ice cubes from a metal container, causing the preparation of the cocktail to commence.
4) After the addition of ice, the bartender pours a clear liquid from another bottle into the glass, leading to the mixture's base being established.
5) The introduction of a light-colored liquid from a different bottle into the glass further develops the cocktail's composition.
6) The bartender shakes the contents of the glass using a metal shaker, causing the ingredients to mix thoroughly.
7) Pouring the shaken mixture back into the glass results in the cocktail nearing its final stage.
8) Finally, the bartender garnishes the drink with a slice of citrus fruit, completing the preparation process and presenting it to the camera.
