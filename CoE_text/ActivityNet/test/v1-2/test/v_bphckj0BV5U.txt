1) The video features a woman in a forested area with fallen leaves on the ground, dressed in a grey long-sleeved shirt and black pants, accessorized with a necklace and bracelets, and she is holding various objects such as a green lighter, a small white object, and a knife.
2) The woman demonstrates how to use these items, which causes her to start by showing the lighter to the camera, then picking up some dry grass from the ground and placing it on a rock.
3) She then uses a knife to scrape against the rock, which leads to creating sparks that ignite the dry grass.
4) This action results in her successfully starting a fire, ending the demonstration.
