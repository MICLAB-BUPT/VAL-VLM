1) In a well-lit kitchen with modern appliances and a cityscape view, two women are preparing a sandwich, which suggests a cooking show setup.
2) The woman on the left, wearing a teal cardigan, is seen spreading a creamy tuna salad mixture onto a piece of bread, causing the base layer of the sandwich to be prepared.
3) The woman on the right, dressed in red, adds potato chips to the sandwich, enhancing its texture and flavor.
4) The woman in red then places another slice of bread on top, completing the sandwich assembly, which results in the final product being held up for display.
