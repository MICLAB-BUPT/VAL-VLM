1) The man starts by spraying the window with a cleaning solution, which causes the dirt and grime on the window to become loose.
2) This action then allows him to use a squeegee to wipe the window clean, removing the loosened dirt along with the cleaning solution.
3) After that, he uses a cloth to dry the window and remove any remaining water spots or streaks, resulting in a spotless pane of glass.
4) The man's careful and methodical approach, including the thorough cleaning of each pane, as well as the window frame and sill using a brush, ensures that the entire window is sparkling clean.
