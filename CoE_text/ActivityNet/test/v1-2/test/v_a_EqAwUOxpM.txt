1) The video shows a close-up of a person's hand with yellow-painted nails, indicating that the person has already applied a yellow base coat to the nail, which is the first step in creating the Minion character.
2) After the yellow base coat, the person uses a fine brush to apply black paint, causing the formation of the Minion's facial features, including the eyes and mouth, on the thumb nail.
3) The application of black and white paint for the Minion's eye, along with the addition of details like the mouth and eyebrows, further develops the design, leading to a more recognizable depiction of the character.
4) The final touch, adding a blue bandana around the Minion's head, completes the nail art, resulting in a fully detailed and colorful representation of the Minion on the fingernail.
