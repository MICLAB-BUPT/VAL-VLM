1) The man, dressed in a white t-shirt, dark shorts, and yellow shoes, is standing on a blue tennis court with green borders, holding a tennis racket in his right hand and a tennis ball in his left.
2) The man bounces the tennis ball with his left hand, which causes him to prepare for his serve by focusing and getting into a rhythm.
3) After bouncing the ball, he tosses it into the air, which leads him to swing his racket back.
4) Swinging the racket back enables him to generate enough force to hit the ball over the net as part of his serve.
