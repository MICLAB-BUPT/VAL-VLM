1) The video shows a woman ironing clothes on an ironing board, and she is wearing a light blue t-shirt and plaid shorts.
2) She starts by spraying the clothes with water, which causes the fabric to become damp and more malleable for ironing.
3) After spraying, she smooths out the wrinkles with her hands, which prepares the fabric for the iron.
4) She then uses the iron to press the clothes, moving it back and forth across the fabric, ensuring that it becomes wrinkle-free.
5) After ironing one section, she adjusts or flips the garment over to iron another area, which ensures that all parts of the clothing are smoothed.
6) She repeats this process for different parts of the clothing, causing the entire garment to become smooth and wrinkle-free.
