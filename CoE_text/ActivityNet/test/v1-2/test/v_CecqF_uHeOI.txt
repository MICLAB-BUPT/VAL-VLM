1) A man is cleaning a glass door with a squeegee and a blue cloth.
2) He starts by using the squeegee to remove water from the top of the door, which causes him to then move down to clean the lower part.
3) After using the squeegee, he uses the cloth to wipe away any remaining water or dirt, ensuring that all areas are thoroughly cleaned.
4) He repeats this process several times, moving from top to bottom and side to side, which results in a clean glass door.
