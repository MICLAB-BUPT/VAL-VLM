1) A young boy is vacuuming a living room, which causes him to move the vacuum cleaner back and forth across the floor.
2) The presence of toys scattered around the room causes the boy to also pick up objects from the floor and put them in the vacuum cleaner.
3) The boy's focus on his task, ensuring that he covers all necessary spots, is caused by his concentration on the areas of the carpet that need cleaning.
