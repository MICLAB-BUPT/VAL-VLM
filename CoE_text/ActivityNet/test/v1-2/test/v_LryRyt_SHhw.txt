1) A person in a blue t-shirt with white text on the back is grooming a brown horse inside a stable, which causes the horse to stand calmly, indicating trust and familiarity between them.
2) The environment is well-lit, likely by natural light, suggesting daytime, which allows the person to clearly see and effectively work through the horse's coat.
3) The person starts using a red curry comb to work through the horse's coat, starting from the neck and moving towards the hindquarters, which leads to the removal of dirt and loose hair from the horse's coat.
4) After using the curry comb, the person switches to using her hands to rub the horse's side, and then uses a red brush to groom the horse's back, which contributes to the shiny and well-maintained appearance of the horse's coat.
