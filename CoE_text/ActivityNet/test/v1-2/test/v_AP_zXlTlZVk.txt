1) The woman, wearing a black shirt and purple apron, is in a commercial kitchen to wash dishes.
2) She starts by using a sponge to clean a large white plate with a red logo on it, causing the dirt and food residues to be removed from the plate.
3) After scrubbing, she rinses the plate under running water from the faucet, which causes the remaining soap and loosened particles to be washed away.
4) She then places the cleaned and rinsed plate on a drying rack next to the sink, where it will air dry.
5) The woman continues this process, carefully scrubbing each dish and utensil before placing them on the drying rack, indicating her focus and dedication to the task.
