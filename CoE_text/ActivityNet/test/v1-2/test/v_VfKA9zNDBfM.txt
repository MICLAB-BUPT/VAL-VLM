1) The video begins with a man riding a bicycle in front of a garage, performing a wheelie, which causes him to stop and adjust something on the bike.
2) This adjustment leads to the man removing the tire from the rim, revealing the inner tube and the tire's structure for inspection.
3) Upon inspection, he uses a tool to puncture the inner tube, causing it to deflate, indicating the need for repair.
4) The deflation of the inner tube then results in the man applying a patch to the punctured area on the inner tube as part of the maintenance process.
5) After the patch is applied, he reattaches the inner tube back onto the tire, ensuring the puncture is sealed and the inner tube can hold air again.
6) Reattaching the inner tube causes the man to then mount the tire back onto the bicycle, making sure to check the alignment of the wheel before proceeding.
7) Checking the alignment ensures the bicycle is safe and ready to ride, completing the maintenance and allowing the man to put the bike back together.
