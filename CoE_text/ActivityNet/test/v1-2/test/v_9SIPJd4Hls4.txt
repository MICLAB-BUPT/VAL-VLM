1) The video begins with a woman in a kitchen setting, wearing a pink cap and apron, standing in front of wooden cabinets and various kitchen appliances.
2) She starts by cutting an apple on a cutting board, which causes the apple to be divided into slices.
3) After cutting the apple, she mixes the apple slices with mayonnaise in a bowl, leading to the creation of a base for the salad.
4) Next, she adds celery, walnuts, and raisins to the mixture, enhancing the flavor and texture of the salad.
5) The woman thoroughly mixes all the ingredients together, ensuring that the flavors are well combined.
6) She then transfers the mixed salad into a smaller bowl and places it in the refrigerator, causing the salad to chill and allowing the flavors to meld.
7) Finally, after a while, she takes out the bowl from the fridge, scoops some salad into another smaller bowl, and tastes it, appearing satisfied with the result.
