1) A woman with shoulder-length dark hair is seated in a room, wearing a black top.
2) She is brushing her hair with a white brush, starting from the roots and moving towards the ends, which causes her hair to become more voluminous and styled.
3) The woman ensures all sections of her hair are smoothed out by starting from the top and then moving to the sides, indicating that her actions are deliberate and focused on achieving a neat hairstyle.
4) As she continues brushing, she occasionally looks at the camera, while the background shows a plain wall with a poster and a desk with papers and a book to her right.
