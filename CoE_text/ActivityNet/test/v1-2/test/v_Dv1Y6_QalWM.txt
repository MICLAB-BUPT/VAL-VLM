1) The video showcases a shoe repair process in a well-equipped workshop, indicating an experienced craftsman at work.
2) The man, presumably the owner, starts by spraying a black suede shoe with a spray bottle, which causes the surface to be prepped for cleaning.
3) He then brushes the shoe with a brush, causing dirt and dust to be removed from the suede.
4) Next, he uses a sponge to clean the shoe thoroughly, further removing any remaining dirt.
5) The application of a substance from a tube onto the shoe, followed by brushing, causes the material to be treated and protected.
6) Using a pencil to mark scuff marks on the shoe, he is able to identify areas that need more attention, causing these specific spots to be targeted during the next round of brushing.
7) For another pair of shoes, he cleans them using a sponge dipped in water, causing the dirt to be loosened and removed.
8) After cleaning, stuffing the shoes with paper maintains their shape, preventing deformation as they dry.
9) Finally, placing the cleaned and repaired shoes into a box suggests the completion of the service, causing the shoes to be ready for return to the customer or storage.
