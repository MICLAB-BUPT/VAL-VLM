1) The video shows a woman in a blue tank top and shorts standing on a grassy field, holding a discus in her right hand.
2) The woman takes a few steps forward, which causes her to build momentum for the throw.
3) She then spins around, which increases the force and speed of the throw.
4) The spinning motion and the built-up momentum cause the woman to throw the discus with a powerful motion.
5) As a result, the discus flies through the air and lands in the distance.
