1) The man, wearing a white shirt and black shorts, stands on a concrete platform in an open field.
2) He holds a discus in his right hand, causing him to swing it back and forth to build momentum.
3) This swinging action leads to him spinning around once, further increasing the momentum.
4) As he spins, he releases the discus into the air, which is the result of the built-up momentum.
5) The discus flies through the air and lands in the distance, caused by the force and direction of the throw.
6) The man watches the discus fly, and after observing its trajectory and landing, he walks away.
