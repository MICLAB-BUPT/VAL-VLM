1) The video depicts a person undergoing a facial piercing procedure in a clinical setting, causing the individual to lie down with their head tilted back, exposing the area for the piercing.
2) A professional wearing gloves and holding a piercing tool approaches the person's face, leading to the careful insertion of the needle through the skin, which creates an opening for the piercing.
