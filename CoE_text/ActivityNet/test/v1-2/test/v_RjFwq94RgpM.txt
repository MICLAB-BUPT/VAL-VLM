1) The video shows a man in a white shirt and black pants preparing to throw a shot put, which causes him to stand on a concrete circle with a white line marking the throwing area.
2) He starts by standing on the edge of the circular area, then bends down to pick up the shot put, causing him to hold it close to his neck with one hand while balancing on one leg.
3) The man takes a few steps back, then approaches the circle and begins to spin around, building momentum, which leads to him releasing the shot put into the air.
4) After a few moments, he throws the shot put with force, extending his arm fully, causing the shot put to fly through the air and land on the field.
5) The man then walks out of the circle, and this action prompts another person, a man in a white shirt and khaki shorts, to approach and measure the distance of the throw using a measuring tape.
