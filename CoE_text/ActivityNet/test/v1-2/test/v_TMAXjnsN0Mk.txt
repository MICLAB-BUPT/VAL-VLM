1) The video begins with the introduction of the UGG Care Kit and the materials needed for cleaning, which causes the viewer to understand what tools are essential for the process.
2) The person starts by stuffing the boots with paper towels to keep them in shape, which is done to ensure that the boots maintain their form during the cleaning process.
3) They then use a UGG-branded brush to remove any loose dirt or stains from the boots, an action that prepares the surface for the application of the cleaning solution.
4) Next, they apply a cleaning solution to the boots using a sponge and lukewarm water, scrubbing gently to remove dirt, which is crucial for deep cleaning without damaging the material.
5) After scrubbing, the boots are left to dry overnight, allowing sufficient time for the moisture to evaporate and preventing potential damage from prolonged dampness.
6) Once the boots are dry, a conditioner is applied to the boots for even coverage, which helps in maintaining the leather's softness and appearance.
7) Finally, they fold the boots upside down and spray a freshener inside to eliminate odors, resulting in clean, well-maintained, and fresh-smelling boots.
