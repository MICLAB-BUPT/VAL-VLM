1) The person places the box on a white sheet of paper and covers it with an orange piece of wrapping paper, which is the initial step to prepare for gift wrapping.
2) They then fold the sides of the orange paper neatly around the box, ensuring all edges are aligned, causing the box to be partially enclosed by the paper.
3) After folding the sides, they proceed to fold the top and bottom flaps of the paper, creating a neat and tidy appearance, leading to the box being fully covered by the orange paper.
4) The person uses tape to secure the orange paper in place, resulting in a securely wrapped box.
5) The wrapped box is then placed on a blue patterned fabric (or green patterned fabric as mentioned in the second answer), which is folded over the box, causing the creation of a decorative outer layer.
6) The fabric is carefully adjusted and secured with tape, leading to an additional protective and aesthetically pleasing cover for the gift.
7) Finally, a label is added to the wrapped box, and a ribbon is tied around it, creating a neat bow on top, which results in a beautifully wrapped gift ready for presentation.
