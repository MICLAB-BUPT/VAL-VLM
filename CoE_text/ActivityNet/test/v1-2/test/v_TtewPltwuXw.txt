1) The video shows a man in a red sweater and jeans sitting on a chair in a living room, playing a flute.
2) This action causes another man, wearing a black and white hoodie and blue pants, to join him, being drawn by the music.
3) Upon joining, the second man sits on a wooden box next to the first man and starts tapping it rhythmically, turning the box into a drum, to complement the melody of the flute.
4) Their combined actions create a musical performance, with both men focusing on their instruments, though the second man occasionally looks at the first, likely to coordinate their play.
