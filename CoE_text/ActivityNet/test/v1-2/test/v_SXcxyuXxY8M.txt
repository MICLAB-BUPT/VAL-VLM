1) The video starts with the woman applying sunscreen to her face, which is a crucial step for protecting the skin, causing her to have a base that is both protected and ready for makeup application.
2) After the sunscreen, she applies foundation and concealer, which cause an even and smooth skin tone, hiding any blemishes or uneven coloration.
3) Following the application of foundation and concealer, she powders her face, which causes the makeup to set and last longer, also helping to reduce shine.
4) She then adds blush to her cheeks, which causes a healthy, natural-looking flush to her complexion.
5) Next, the application of eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara occurs, causing her eyes to be more defined and enhanced, drawing attention to them.
6) Finally, she applies lipstick, which causes her lips to stand out and completes her overall polished and natural makeup look.
7) After finishing with her makeup, she styles her hair into a bun, which complements her makeup, causing a neat and put-together appearance.
