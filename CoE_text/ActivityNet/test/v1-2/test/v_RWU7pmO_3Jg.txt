1) The video features a woman and a man seated at a table, engaging in a beauty routine, which is the setting for both scenarios.
2) In the first scenario, their beauty routine causes them to start by washing their faces, with the woman applying a cleanser and massaging it into her skin, and the man follows suit to ensure thorough cleansing.
3) This cleansing step then causes them to exfoliate using a muslin cloth, gently rubbing it over their faces to remove dead skin cells, as a continuation of the skincare process.
4) After exfoliation, they apply eye cream, focusing on the delicate under-eye area, completing the skincare routine in the first scenario.
5) In the second scenario, instead of continuing with skincare, the beauty routine causes the woman to start applying makeup to her face, while the man watches attentively.
6) The application of makeup, including foundation, eyeshadow, and lipstick, is the main activity in this part of the beauty routine, with the man occasionally commenting and providing tips.
