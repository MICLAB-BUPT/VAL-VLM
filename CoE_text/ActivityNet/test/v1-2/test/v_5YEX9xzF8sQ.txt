1) The video shows a female diver preparing for a dive from a high platform, wearing a black swimsuit and having her hair tied up in a bun. The platform is white with blue accents, and there are other people visible on the platform above her, likely spectators or fellow divers.
2) With her arms raised above her head, she walks to the edge of the platform, which is elevated and has railings around it, causing her to pause briefly before jumping off.
3) This action causes her to perform a flip in the air, leading to her entering the water, which appears to be a swimming pool or diving facility, below.
