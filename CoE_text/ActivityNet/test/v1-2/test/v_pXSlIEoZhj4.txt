1) The video starts with a person, wearing a blue denim shirt and sitting at a wooden table with a black mat in front of them, holding a brown leather shoe.
2) The person applies the cleaner (renovator) to the shoe, initially testing it on a small, hidden part of the shoe to ensure it doesn't damage the material, which causes them to proceed with confidence that the renovator is safe for use.
3) They then apply the renovator to the rest of the shoe in circular motions, ensuring even coverage, which leads to the thorough distribution of the product across the shoe's surface.
4) After leaving the renovator on the shoe for five minutes, allowing it to work effectively, they use the white cloth to wipe off any excess, causing the shoe to become cleaner and more polished.
5) The video ends with the person showing the clean, now well-maintained shoe, as a result of their careful cleaning process.
