1) The video shows an indoor sports facility where a shot put event is taking place, and the man in a blue shirt and black shorts prepares to throw the shot put.
2) This preparation causes him to take a few steps forward and throw the shot put with great force.
3) After the throw, he walks away from the throwing area, which then allows the observers to measure the distance of the throw using a measuring tape.
4) The completion of the measurement causes the man in the blue shirt to return to the throwing area, and the process repeats.
