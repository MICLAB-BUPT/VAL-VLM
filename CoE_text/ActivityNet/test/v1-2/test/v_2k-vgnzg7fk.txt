1) The video showcases a step-by-step makeup tutorial, which starts with the woman holding up a tube of foundation and then applying it to her face using a brush, causing an even base for the makeup.
2) Following the application of the foundation, she uses a compact powder case and applies the powder to her face with a brush, and then uses a makeup sponge to blend the foundation and powder together, ensuring a smooth finish.
3) After setting the base, she holds up and applies concealer to her under-eye area and blends it in, which is done to cover any dark circles or blemishes.
4) She then moves on to apply blush on her cheeks, adding color and dimension to her face.
5) The next step involves applying eyeshadow on her eyelids, followed by eyeliner to her eyes, enhancing the appearance of her eyes.
6) She applies mascara to her eyelashes, making them appear longer and fuller, and brow gel to her eyebrows, giving them a neat and defined look.
7) Finally, she puts on lipstick, in this case, lip gloss, to her lips, completing the makeup look, and smiles at the camera, showcasing the finished result.
