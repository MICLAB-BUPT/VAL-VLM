1) The woman in a red top standing behind a table with various items, including a pink gift bag, scissors, ribbons, and a bottle, decides to demonstrate how to wrap the bottle using the pink gift bag, which causes her to begin the wrapping process.
2) She carefully folds and ties the pink gift bag around the bottle, ensuring it is securely wrapped, which leads to the bottle being fully covered by the pink paper.
3) After wrapping, she ties a ribbon around the neck of the bottle, adding a decorative touch, which completes the demonstration of how to wrap and decorate the bottle.
