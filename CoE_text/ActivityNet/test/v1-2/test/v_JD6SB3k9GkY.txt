1) The video begins with a woman in a kitchen setting, wearing a blue top and holding a yellow squash.
2) She explains the process of preparing the squash, which causes her to cut it in half on a wooden cutting board.
3) After cutting, she scoops out the seeds and pulp, leading to the placement of the squash halves into a glass baking dish.
4) She adds water to the dish, causing the squash to be ready for baking.
5) Placing the dish in the oven, she then waits until the squash is baked, after which she removes it from the oven.
6) Using a fork, she mashes the flesh inside the squash, which results in the cooked flesh being transferred into a white bowl.
7) She mixes the mashed squash with a tomato-based sauce, leading to the addition of fresh basil leaves as a garnish.
8) Finally, these steps cause the completion of the dish, which she tastes.
