1) The video shows a weightlifter in a blue and red singlet attempting to lift a barbell loaded with red and blue weight plates, which causes the lifter to start by bending down to grip the barbell.
2) The lifter successfully lifts the barbell from the ground to his chest, which is part of executing a clean motion, lifting the barbell from the ground to their shoulders while maintaining a squatting position.
3) After the clean, the lifter then pushes it overhead, which is the jerk motion where the barbell is pushed from the shoulders to a fully extended position above the head.
4) Holding it steady for a moment before dropping it to the floor, the athlete completes the lift, which leads to the athlete celebrating by raising their arms in triumph.
