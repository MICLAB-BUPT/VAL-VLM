1) The video shows a man running on a grassy field while holding a javelin.
2) He runs with the javelin held high above his head, which causes him to build momentum and prepare for the throw.
3) As he builds up enough momentum, he throws the javelin forward with force, causing it to fly through the air towards the distant goalposts.
4) After releasing the javelin, he continues to run for a short distance before slowing down and coming to a stop, allowing him to watch the javelin's trajectory.
