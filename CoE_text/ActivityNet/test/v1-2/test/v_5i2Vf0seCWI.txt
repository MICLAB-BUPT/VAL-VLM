1) The video begins with a title screen introducing 'How to Wash Your Face' featuring Dr. Bobbi Edwards, M.D., from Michigan Skin Associates & Dermatology in Southfield, Michigan.
2) This causes the scene to transition to a woman standing in a bathroom setting, wearing a brown top and earrings, with a sink, faucet, soap dispenser, and a clear plastic bowl filled with water on the counter behind her.
3) She starts by explaining the process of washing your face, which leads her to gesture towards the bowl and sink.
4) Her explanation then causes her to demonstrate the steps, including wetting her hands, applying soap, lathering, and rinsing her face.
5) Throughout the demonstration, she emphasizes the importance of thorough cleansing and proper technique, leading to a consistent background with a framed picture on the wall and various bathroom items visible.
6) After washing her face, she dries it with a towel, which concludes the demonstration.
7) This action results in the video ending with another title screen displaying contact information for Dr. Edwards' office.
