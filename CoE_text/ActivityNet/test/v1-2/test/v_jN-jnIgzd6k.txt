1) The children are in a dojo, which is a designated space for martial arts practice, cause it provides a suitable and safe environment for them to learn and perform karate.
2) The children are dressed in white karate uniforms with green belts, indicating their level of proficiency, cause the uniform and belt system is a traditional way to denote the skill level of karate practitioners.
3) The presence of an instructor guiding the children's movements causes the students to be able to learn and execute their martial arts techniques correctly and in a synchronized manner.
4) The dojo has mirrors on the walls, which allow the children to see their own reflections as they practice, cause this visual feedback helps them to improve their form and technique by self-observation.
