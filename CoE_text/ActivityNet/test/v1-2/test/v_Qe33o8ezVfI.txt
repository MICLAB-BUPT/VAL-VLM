1) The video begins with a woman standing in front of an easel, preparing to paint, which causes her to start the process by applying blue paint to the canvas using broad strokes.
2) She creates a gradient effect from dark blue at the top to lighter blue towards the bottom, which leads her to add white paint to the lower part of the canvas, forming clouds or waves.
3) Throughout the video, she uses various brushes and tools to blend the colors smoothly, causing the scene to transition between her painting on the canvas and close-ups of her hands as she works.
4) In another sequence, she pours paint onto the canvas and uses a brush to spread it around, leading to the addition of more layers of paint, creating a gradient effect from light blue at the top to white at the bottom.
5) Finally, she uses a sponge to dab on some white paint, creating a cloud-like shape in the sky area of her painting, which results in the completion of the artwork.
6) The video ends with a title screen displaying 'Expert Village' and contact information, signifying the conclusion of the demonstration.
