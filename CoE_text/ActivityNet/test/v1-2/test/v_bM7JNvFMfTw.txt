1) A person in a blue hoodie, identified as a young man wearing glasses, is washing his hands at a stainless steel sink.
2) The presence of a black paper towel dispenser, a white curtain, and a soap dispenser with a label featuring three paw prints suggests the setting is likely a medical or veterinary clinic, which causes the environment to look clean and professional, with white walls and cabinets that indicate a sterile setting.
3) The young man uses soap from the dispenser, causing him to thoroughly lather his hands under running water, ensuring all areas are covered.
4) After rinsing off the soap, the thorough cleaning of his hands causes him to dry them using a paper towel from the dispenser.
