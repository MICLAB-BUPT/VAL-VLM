1) The video begins with a view of a gym setting, featuring a large Union Jack flag on the wall and various gym equipment scattered around. A barbell is positioned in the center of the frame.
2) A woman, initially described as wearing an orange tank top and black shorts (and later as being in a red and black outfit), enters the frame from the right side, causing her to approach the barbell.
3) She bends down to grip the barbell, which leads to her lifting it off the ground to her chest level.
4) Lifting the barbell to her chest level causes her to then perform the next step, which is lifting the barbell above her head.
5) After lifting the barbell overhead, she holds it there for a moment, and this action is followed by her lowering or dropping it back to the ground.
6) The completion of the lift causes her to step back and walk away from the barbell.
