1) The video begins with a title screen displaying the name of the drink, 'CUTECUMBER', and the brand 'Enjoy Your Life Nørkoping', setting the stage for the cocktail preparation.
2) The bartender, dressed in a black shirt and red tie, starts the process by muddling cucumber slices at the bottom of a glass, which is the first step to infuse the flavor into the cocktail.
3) After muddling, the addition of Bombay Sapphire gin and St Germain liqueur follows, providing the base alcohol and a sweet, floral note to the mixture, enhancing the overall taste profile.
4) The inclusion of lemon juice and ginger syrup from separate pitchers causes the introduction of citrusy and spicy elements, balancing the flavors of the cocktail.
5) In one version, the addition of egg white is mentioned, which would cause the creation of a frothy texture when shaken, adding a creamy element to the cocktail's mouthfeel.
6) The bartender shakes the mixture vigorously, causing all the ingredients to blend thoroughly and chill, ensuring the cocktail is well-mixed and refreshing.
7) Pouring the mixed and chilled cocktail into a glass filled with ice cubes prepares it for immediate serving, keeping the drink cold and ready to enjoy.
8) Finally, garnishing the drink with a cucumber slice and, depending on the version, mint leaves or a straw, completes the presentation, making the 'CUTECUMBER' cocktail visually appealing and ready to be served.
