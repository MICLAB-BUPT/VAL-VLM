1) A young girl, wearing a white tank top, black leggings, and pink sandals, is playing hopscotch in a backyard.
2) The hopscotch grid, drawn on the ground with chalk, causes her to hop through the numbered squares, sometimes on one foot and other times on two feet.
3) As part of the game, she bends down to pick up a rock from one of the squares, which then causes her to throw the rock into another square.
4) The action of picking up and throwing the rock, along with hopping through the grid, allows her to continue playing hopscotch, thereby causing her to appear to be enjoying herself as she moves through the course.
