1) The video shows a person in a white shirt pouring a liquid from a bottle into metal containers on a table, which causes the containers to be filled with the liquid.
2) After filling each container, the man places the lid back on it, causing the contents to be sealed.
3) The man then hands the sealed container to another person, indicating that the preparation or distribution process is completed for that specific container.
