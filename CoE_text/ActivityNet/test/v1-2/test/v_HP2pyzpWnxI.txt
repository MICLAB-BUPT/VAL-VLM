This action leads to 3) the chef mixing the salad thoroughly using tongs to ensure an even distribution of all elements, which results in 4) the final step where he plates the mixed salad onto a white plate, presenting it neatly and attractively, showcasing vibrant colors and textures of the ingredients.
