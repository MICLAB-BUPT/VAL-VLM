1) The video shows a woman sitting on a bench with her legs extended, indicating she is preparing for a treatment or service.
2) Another person is seen applying lotion or cream to the woman's legs, massaging it in thoroughly, which suggests the purpose is for moisturizing and relaxing the muscles.
3) However, in another scenario, a woman is sitting on a bench and getting her legs waxed by another person, showing a different treatment being applied.
4) The person waxing the woman's legs is using a wax strip and an orange stick to apply the wax, indicating the process of hair removal, not moisturizing.
5) The discrepancy between the two scenarios (moisturizing vs. waxing) suggests that these are two separate events, both involving a woman receiving a leg treatment while seated on a bench, but with different intended outcomes: one for skin hydration and relaxation, the other for hair removal.
