1) The video begins with a title screen, which causes the viewer to understand the content that will be demonstrated: a weightlifting combo including a power clean, front squat, and jerk.
2) The scene then transitions to a gym, where a man is preparing for the exercise, causing him to position himself in front of a barbell loaded with colorful weight plates.
3) The man bends down and grips the barbell, causing him to lift it off the ground and transition into a squat position while holding the barbell at shoulder height, thus completing the power clean.
4) After standing up fully from the power clean, he performs a front squat, which is caused by lowering himself back down while keeping the barbell in front of him.
5) Finally, the completion of the front squat causes him to stand up and execute the jerk, pushing the barbell overhead and locking his arms.
6) Successfully completing the jerk causes him to drop the barbell to the floor and step back, concluding the weightlifting combo.
