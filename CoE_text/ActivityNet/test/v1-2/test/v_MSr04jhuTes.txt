1) The video shows a woman in a black shirt preparing to iron a blue shirt, which causes her to lay the shirt flat on an ironing board.
2) Laying the shirt flat and smoothing it out with her hands causes the woman to then use an iron to press the fabric, moving it back and forth across the shirt.
3) Using the iron to press the fabric causes her to carefully iron each section of the shirt, including the collar, sleeves, and body, ensuring all wrinkles are smoothed out.
4) After completing the ironing process, this action causes her to lift the shirt off the ironing board and hold it up to display the final, neatly ironed result.
