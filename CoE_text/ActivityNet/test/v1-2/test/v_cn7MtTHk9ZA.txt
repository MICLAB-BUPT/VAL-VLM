1) In a home kitchen with white tiled walls and wooden cabinets, a woman in a white t-shirt is washing dishes at the sink, which causes the young child in pajamas to stand beside her and reach up to help with the dishes.
2) The sink is filled with soapy water and various baby bottles and utensils, which leads to the child focusing on rinsing a bottle under running water from the faucet.
3) The woman is holding a sponge and scrubbing a dish, which prompts the child to watch her intently and then reach for a dish to begin washing it under the running water.
4) The woman helps the child by guiding their hands and providing encouragement, which results in the child becoming more confident and independent as they continue washing dishes together.
