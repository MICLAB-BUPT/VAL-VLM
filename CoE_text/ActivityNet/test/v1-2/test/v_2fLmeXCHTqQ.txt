1) The video starts with a man standing behind a bar counter, surrounded by various bottles of alcohol and bar tools.
2) He begins by pouring whiskey into a glass filled with ice cubes, which is the base for the cocktail he is preparing.
3) Next, he adds a shot of another liquor from a bottle labeled 'Allen' to the whiskey and ice, causing the mixture to become more complex in flavor.
4) Following this, he pours a liquid (described as clear in one answer and dark in the other, so we will consider it as an additional ingredient) from a small bottle into the glass, further enhancing the taste and complexity of the drink.
5) The man then stirs the drink with a long spoon, ensuring that all the ingredients are well mixed and the flavors are evenly distributed throughout the cocktail.
6) Finally, he pours the mixed drink into a martini glass, completing the preparation process and presenting the finished cocktail.
