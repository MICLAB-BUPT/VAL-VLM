1) The person starts by cutting two equal squares of wrapping paper, which is the initial step in preparing to wrap the odd-shaped gift.
2) They then double-tape the bottom sheet to create a pocket, causing a secure base for the gift to be placed inside.
3) Next, laying a second sheet on top to form a pocket and dropping in the gift ensures that the gift is fully enclosed and ready for the next steps.
4) Adding tape to the fourth side and sealing it, followed by cutting the border, results in a neatly wrapped package.
5) Finally, adding a bow on top of the wrapped gift completes the process, enhancing its appearance.
