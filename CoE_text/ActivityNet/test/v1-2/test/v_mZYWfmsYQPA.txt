2) The man's movement to the other side of the table, along with his demonstration of various strokes and movements, is caused by his intention to provide a comprehensive tutorial on table tennis techniques.
3) His use of hand gestures and clear instructions, while occasionally hitting the ball against the net, is caused by his aim to ensure that viewers can easily understand and follow the demonstrated techniques.
