1) The woman, wearing a pink shirt and gray pants, is grooming a horse with a brown coat and a white stripe down its face in a stable, which causes the horse to stand patiently.
2) The woman's action of brushing different areas of the horse's body, such as the neck and back, leads her to move around the horse to ensure all parts are covered.
3) The horse occasionally moves its head towards a bucket attached to the wall, which does not disrupt the woman's grooming process.
