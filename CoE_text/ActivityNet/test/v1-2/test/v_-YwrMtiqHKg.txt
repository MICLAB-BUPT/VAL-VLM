1) The video begins with a title screen, which causes the viewer to understand the topic is about "Baking Soda Face Wash".
2) This introduction then transitions to showing a person holding a box of baking soda, a spoon, and a bowl, causing the viewer to anticipate the preparation of the face wash.
3) The person mixes the baking soda with water in a bowl, creating a face wash mixture, which causes the transformation of the ingredients into a usable form for facial application.
4) The application of the mixture to their face using hands ensures even coverage, causing the initiation of the cleansing process on the skin.
5) Waiting for five minutes after applying the mixture allows it to work on the skin, causing the intended effects of the face wash to take place.
6) Rinsing the face with water from a sink removes all traces of the mixture, causing the completion of the face washing process.
7) Finally, the person stands in front of a window with the text "FINISHED" appearing on the screen, indicating the conclusion of the activity and possibly signaling the successful end of the face washing process.
