1) The video shows a man standing outside a building, talking and gesturing with his hands, which causes him to appear as if he is explaining something, possibly related to the building or its surroundings.
2) This explanation leads him to pick up a bucket and a long-handled tool, causing him to climb onto the bucket to reach higher areas of the glass door.
3) Climbing onto the bucket allows him to use the tool to clean or work on the windows, which results in him cleaning the windows of the building.
4) After completing the task of cleaning the windows, he steps down from the bucket, which causes him to continue talking and gesturing.
