1) The video shows a woman in a blue shirt cooking pasta in a kitchen.
2) She starts by pouring the cooked pasta into a colander, causing the excess water to drain.
3) After draining, she transfers the pasta to a pot on the stove.
4) Next, she adds water to the pot and stirs the pasta with a wooden spoon, which is done to ensure even distribution of water and to prevent the pasta from sticking.
