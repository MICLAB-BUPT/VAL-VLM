1) The gymnast mounts the beam, which is the initial action that sets the stage for her routine.
2) After mounting, she starts by balancing on one leg, demonstrating her balance and control, which is a fundamental skill in gymnastics.
3) Balancing on one leg then causes her to transition into a split leap with arms extended, showcasing her flexibility and grace.
4) This split leap leads to a series of movements including a handstand, a turn, and a jump, each requiring different aspects of her training such as strength, precision, and agility.
5) Throughout the routine, the gymnast maintains her balance and form, which is essential for the successful execution of each movement and the overall performance.
