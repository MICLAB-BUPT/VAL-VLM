1) The video begins with a white screen transitioning to the 'eHow' logo in green text on a white background, which then shifts to a maroon background with the word 'style' in white cursive font, accompanied by a small 'eHow' logo in the top left corner.
2) This introduction causes the scene to transition to a salon setting where two women are present; one is seated while the other stands behind her. 
3) The standing woman, wearing a black top and holding a curling iron, explains something, gesturing with her hands, which leads to her demonstrating how to use the curling iron on the seated woman's hair, which is dark and curly.
4) The standing woman carefully wraps sections of the seated woman's hair around the curling iron, showing the technique for achieving curls, which results in the seated woman's hair being styled into loose curls.
5) Throughout the demonstration, she continues to explain the process verbally, which helps in guiding the viewer through the steps of the hair styling process.
6) The background, featuring a painting of a tree with blue flowers (or purple as mentioned in the second answer), a black salon chair, and decorative items like dried plants, provides a visually appealing and relevant setting for the tutorial.
7) The video concludes with the 'eHow' logo animation on a white background, followed by a black screen displaying the text 'video filmed by Victor Curtis' in white font, which signifies the end of the instructional content.
