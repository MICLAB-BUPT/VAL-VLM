1) A person in a blue shirt is playing badminton alone in an indoor gymnasium, which causes them to focus on their own practice and skills.
2) The environment, well-lit by natural light from the windows, allows for clear visibility, which enables the person to better see and hit the shuttlecock.
3) The high ceilings of the gymnasium provide ample space for the shuttlecock to travel, which permits the person to practice a wider range of shots, including hitting the shuttlecock upwards repeatedly.
4) The presence of other individuals engaging in various activities in the background does not distract the main subject, as they are focused on their repetitive movements and serve practice.
5) The wooden floors and visible markings for sports, along with the set-up net, create a suitable and defined area for badminton, which supports the person's practice session.
6) The woman, dressed in a blue shirt and jeans, moves around the court and occasionally looks towards other players, indicating that while she is primarily practicing, she is also aware of her surroundings.
