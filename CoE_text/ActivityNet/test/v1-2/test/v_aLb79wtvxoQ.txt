1) The video begins with a shot of a kitchen sink filled with dirty dishes, causing the person to start the cleaning process.
2) The person pours dish soap into the sink, which causes the water to become soapy, preparing it for washing the dishes.
3) The person then starts scrubbing a pot with a sponge, and after it is cleaned, they rinse it under running water, causing the removal of all the dirt and soap.
4) After rinsing, the person places the cleaned pot in a drying rack, allowing it to air dry or prepare for manual drying.
5) The person continues this process by washing other dishes, including a frying pan and a spoon, using the same method of scrubbing and rinsing, which causes each item to be thoroughly cleaned.
