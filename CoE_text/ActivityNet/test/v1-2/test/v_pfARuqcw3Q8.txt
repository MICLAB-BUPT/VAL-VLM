1) The man, dressed in a yellow shirt and blue pants, stands on the red track holding the discus in his right hand, which is the starting position for his discus throw.
2) He then begins to spin, building momentum as he rotates, causing an increase in speed and power with each rotation, preparing for the final release of the discus.
3) As he completes his spin, the built-up momentum causes him to release the discus with a powerful throw, sending it flying through the air.
4) After each throw, the need to continue practicing causes him to walk back to retrieve the discus and repeat the process.
