1) The video starts with a woman in a white polo shirt standing behind a table, explaining the process of making a homemade furniture polish.
2) She begins by pouring a yellow liquid from a large bottle into a measuring cup and then into a spray bottle, which is the first step in creating the polish.
3) Next, she adds a green liquid from another bottle into the same spray bottle, combining it with the yellow liquid to form the base of the polish.
4) After that, she pours a clear liquid from a small container into the spray bottle, adding an additional component to the mixture to enhance its properties.
5) The woman then attaches a red nozzle to the spray bottle and shakes it vigorously, causing the ingredients to mix thoroughly and create the final product.
6) Finally, she uses a cloth to wipe down a wooden table after spraying the polish on it, demonstrating the effectiveness of the homemade polish.
