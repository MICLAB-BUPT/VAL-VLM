1) The video begins with a black screen displaying white text that reads 'GREGORY ITTS' and 'What Are You Fed Up With', followed by a quote in Russian, which translates to 'I carried a cow.' The text also mentions 'Carnival in Venice - Venetian carnival' and credits 'ITTSITS GREGORY & NACY NEVMI (flute) (piano)'.
2) This introductory screen causes the scene to transition to a close-up of a person's mouth playing a silver flute.
3) The camera then zooms out, revealing two individuals, both wearing red shirts, playing the flute together, standing in front of a wall adorned with framed pictures.
4) The focus shifts between their hands on the flute and their synchronized movements as they play, which is because the man is holding the flute with his left hand and the woman is holding it with her right hand, and they are both looking at each other as they play.
5) Their coordinated performance and shared gaze cause them to finish their piece and smile at each other, concluding the video.
