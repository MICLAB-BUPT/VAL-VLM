1) The person with red hair and a pink headband sits in a chair, causing the piercer to be able to access their ear easily.
2) The piercer, wearing blue gloves, begins the procedure, which causes the individual getting the piercing to remain still.
3) The piercer carefully inserts a needle into the person's earlobe, creating a new piercing hole, which then allows for the insertion of jewelry.
4) The use of a clamp by the piercer to hold the earlobe in place facilitates the secure insertion of the new earring into the piercing.
5) The piercer adjusts the newly inserted jewelry, ensuring it is secure, which causes the completion of the ear-piercing process.
6) The presence of multiple earrings, including a prominent Superman logo earring, on the person's ear indicates that they have had previous piercings, leading to their familiarity with the process.
