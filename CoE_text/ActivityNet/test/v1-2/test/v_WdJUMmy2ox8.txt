1) The video shows two men sitting on a couch in a dimly lit room, one wearing a black shirt and the other a red jacket.
2) The man in the black shirt is holding a hookah pipe/hose and smoking it, which causes him to exhale smoke rings.
3) The man in the red jacket, who initially is looking at his phone, then takes the hookah pipe/hose from the man in the black shirt, which leads to him also starting to smoke.
4) This action of passing and taking the hookah pipe/hose causes both men to continue smoking and exhaling smoke rings together throughout the video.
