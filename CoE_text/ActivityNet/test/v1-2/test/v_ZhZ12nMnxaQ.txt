1) The video begins with a person placing a white box on a brown paper surface, which causes them to cut the brown paper around it.
2) After cutting the brown paper, the person rolls out red wrapping paper with Christmas designs, causing them to measure and cut this paper to size.
3) The person then places the white box on the cut red paper, which leads to them folding the paper over the box.
4) As they fold the sides neatly, ensuring the box is fully covered, this action results in the need to secure the wrapping with tape.
5) Finally, after securing the wrapping, the person holds up the wrapped gift, showcasing their work.
