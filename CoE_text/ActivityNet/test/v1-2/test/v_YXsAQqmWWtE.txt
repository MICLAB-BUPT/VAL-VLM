1) The video showcases a series of athletes, including a man in an orange shirt and black shorts, preparing for their hammer throws in an outdoor sports field, which causes them to focus and build up their intensity.
2) The athletes, as part of their preparation, start swinging the hammer around their bodies, gaining momentum with each rotation, which leads to them spinning around with the hammer.
3) After building sufficient momentum, the athletes, such as the man in the orange shirt, release the hammer into the air, causing it to fly towards the field.
4) Once the hammer lands, the athletes walk out of the throwing area, and this action prompts officials to measure the distance of the throw using a measuring tape.
5) The measurement results are then displayed on a scoreboard, indicating the performance of each athlete, which is a standard procedure in the event.
6) The entire process, from preparation to execution and measurement, is captured in the video, showcasing the hammer throw event during the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, as evidenced by the inclusion of the games' logo.
