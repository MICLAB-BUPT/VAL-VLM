1) The video showcases a female athlete in a blue and white uniform preparing for and executing a shot put throw at an outdoor track and field event, which causes her to stand in a shot put circle holding a yellow shot put ball.
2) She begins her routine by winding up, swinging her arm back, and then forcefully releasing the ball into the air, which is executed by starting from a concrete platform, holding the shot put close to her neck with her right hand, rotating her body to the left, swinging her left arm back, pivoting on her right foot, shifting her weight onto her left leg, and finally extending her right arm forward to release the shot put.
3) After the throw, the shot put lands on the grassy field beyond the throwing area, causing a man in a gray shirt and khaki shorts to measure the distance of the throw using a measuring tape.
4) The athlete exits the circle and walks away as other athletes and spectators move around the field, indicating the completion of her attempt.
