1) A person, who is a woman, is playing hopscotch on a playground.
2) The ground of the playground is an asphalt surface and has white painted squares forming the hopscotch pattern, which causes the woman to hop on one foot, then two feet as she moves through the squares.
3) Wearing a white sleeveless top and blue jeans, the woman continues her game, and at some point, she squats down to touch the ground, which is part of the rules of the game.
4) Her long, dark hair flows behind her as she hops, due to the motion of her body.
5) It appears to be daytime, with natural light casting shadows on the ground, which allows for clear visibility of the surroundings.
6) In the background, there's an open space with trees, buildings, and parked cars visible in the distance, indicating that the playground is located in a populated area.
7) There's also a black object lying on the ground near the hopscotch pattern, but it does not seem to interfere with the woman's play.
