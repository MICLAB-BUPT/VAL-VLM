1) The man is wearing a yellow vest and black pants, which is likely for safety and visibility, causing him to be easily noticeable while working.
2) The man is standing on a ladder, which allows him to reach the roof of the conservatory, enabling him to clean it effectively.
3) He is using a long pole with a brush attached to the end, which enables him to clean the glass roof of the conservatory from his position on the ladder without having to step onto the fragile surface.
4) The methodical back and forth movement of the brush across the roof ensures that all areas are cleaned, leading to a thorough cleaning of the conservatory's roof.
