1) The video opens with a person standing on a tennis court, holding a racket, dressed in black attire and preparing for a serve, which causes the scene to focus on the initial action of serving.
2) As the person serves the ball, their body is captured mid-motion, leading the camera to pan and follow the trajectory of the ball as it flies over the net towards the other side of the court, indicating the direction and force of the serve.
3) After serving the ball, the man then runs to the right side of the court, causing the camera to shift its focus from the ball's trajectory to following his movement across the court.
