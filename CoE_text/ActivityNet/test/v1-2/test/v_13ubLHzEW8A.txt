1) The video begins with a woman demonstrating how to curl hair using hair rollers, causing her to start by sectioning her hair and rolling it onto the rollers, securing them in place.
2) After securing the rollers, she uses a hairdryer to dry her hair while still wearing the rollers, which leads to the setting of the curls.
3) In one version, after drying, she removes the rollers from her hair, revealing bouncy curls, and this causes her to style her hair with a comb and mousse for a finished look.
4) In another version, after 24 hours, she removes the rollers and styles her hair with her hands, resulting in healthy, undamaged curls.
