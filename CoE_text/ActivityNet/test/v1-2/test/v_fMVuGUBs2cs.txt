1) The bartender, dressed in a formal vest and tie, is in a well-lit bar setting, which causes him to have the appropriate environment and tools for preparing a cocktail.
2) He begins by pouring fresh lemon juice into a shaker, followed by Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, ground black pepper, sea salt, celery salt, vodka, and tomato juice, which causes the ingredients to be combined in the shaker.
3) The mixture is then shaken vigorously, causing the ingredients to blend together thoroughly.
4) Shaking the mixture leads to it being strained into a tall glass filled with ice, causing the drink to be served chilled.
5) Finally, garnishing the drink with a celery stalk and a lemon slice causes the Bloody Mary to be presented in an appealing and traditional manner.
