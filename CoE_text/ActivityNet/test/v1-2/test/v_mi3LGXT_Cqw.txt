1) The video begins with a title screen featuring the names 'Adam & Alton' and the word 'Pasta', setting the context for the cooking demonstration.
2) It transitions to a kitchen setting where a stainless steel pot is placed on a stove, and water is poured in, preparing the vessel for cooking pasta.
3) The burner is turned on, causing the water to heat up and eventually boil, which is necessary for cooking the pasta.
4) A hand adds salt to the boiling water, enhancing the flavor of the pasta that will be cooked in it.
5) Uncooked spaghetti is then placed into the boiling water, starting the cooking process.
6) The pasta is stirred with tongs as it cooks, preventing it from sticking together and ensuring even cooking.
7) After the pasta is cooked, it is transferred to a colander for draining, removing excess water.
8) Olive oil is poured over the drained pasta, adding moisture and flavor while also preventing the pasta from sticking.
9) Mince garlic is added to the pasta, infusing it with additional flavor.
10) Grated cheese is sprinkled over the pasta, contributing to its creamy texture and rich taste.
11) The pasta is mixed with nuts using tongs, incorporating all the ingredients evenly.
12) Alternatively, instead of mixing with nuts, the pasta with olive oil, minced garlic, and grated cheese is transferred into a baking dish, indicating a different method of final preparation.
13) The pasta is then baked in the oven until the cheese melts and the edges turn golden brown, completing the dish with a crispy, melted cheese topping.
