1) The video shows a man with a beard and mustache, who is in a bathroom setting, wearing a patterned shirt.
2) He starts by trimming his facial hair using scissors, holding them close to his face and carefully trimming his beard and mustache in a precise manner, which causes the facial hair to become more neat and well-groomed.
3) After trimming, he then switches to shaving his beard with a razor, holding it in his right hand, which further refines his appearance.
4) He proceeds to shave, moving the razor downwards from his cheek to his chin, causing the remaining hair to be removed and his skin to become smooth.
5) Finally, he rinses his face with water and dries it with a towel, completing the grooming process.
