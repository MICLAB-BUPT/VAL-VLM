1) A man in a red shirt and blue jeans is attempting to start a fire in a backyard.
2) He pours gasoline from an orange container onto a pile of wood, which causes the wood to be more flammable.
3) The man then throws a lit match into the pile, but the fire starts and quickly goes out, causing him to try again with another match.
4) Another attempt with a match also fails to ignite the fire, leading him to seek an alternative method.
5) He uses a long stick to light the fire, which catches on and burns brightly, indicating his successful ignition.
6) Alternatively, after pouring the gasoline, he walks away, leaving the container behind, possibly to find a better way to ignite the fire.
7) He bends down near a pile of logs, arranging them or picking something up, preparing for a more effective ignition.
8) Finally, he returns with a flaming torch, igniting the pile of wood and creating a large fire, showing a different but equally successful approach.
