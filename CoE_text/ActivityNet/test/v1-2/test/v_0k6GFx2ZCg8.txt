1) The video showcases the preparation of a turkey sandwich, which starts with a person spreading mayonnaise on two slices of bread, causing the base for the sandwich to be established.
2) After spreading the mayonnaise, the person adds turkey slices onto one of the bread slices, leading to the primary protein component of the sandwich being set.
3) Following the addition of turkey, the person places cucumber and tomato slices on top of the turkey, resulting in added freshness and texture to the sandwich.
4) Then, the person adds lettuce (and spinach, as mentioned in the second answer) to complete the layers of ingredients, contributing to the overall nutritional value and crunchiness of the sandwich.
5) The sandwich is then cut in half with a knife, revealing the layers of ingredients inside, and this action prepares the sandwich for serving or eating.
