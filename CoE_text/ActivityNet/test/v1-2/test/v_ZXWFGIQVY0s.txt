1) The man, dressed in a black shirt and shorts, is standing on the snowy ground, which is part of a driveway, holding a green shovel with a black handle, indicating he is prepared to clear the snow.
2) The presence of snow covering the driveway causes the man to start shoveling, as he bends down to scoop up the snow, a necessary step to clear the path.
3) After scooping, the man tosses the snow aside into a pile, an action that is repeated multiple times, showing his determination and the effort required to clear the driveway.
4) The deliberate and focused movements of the man, along with the repetition of scooping and tossing, cause the gradual clearing of the driveway, allowing for safer and easier passage.
