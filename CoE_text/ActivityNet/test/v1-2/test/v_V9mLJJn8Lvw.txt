1) The video begins with a person standing behind a wooden table, placing an orange book on the table.
2) This action causes them to then proceed to wrap the book in white paper, followed by wrapping it in red and blue striped paper.
3) As they carefully fold and tape the paper around the book, ensuring it is neatly wrapped, this leads to the alignment of the edges and smoothing out of the paper for a neat appearance.
4) After completing the folding and taping process, which ensures all sides are covered and the edges are sharp, the person places the wrapped book back on the table, showcasing their work.
