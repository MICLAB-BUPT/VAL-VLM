1) A woman is standing on a wooden deck, wearing a white tank top and black shorts. She has blonde hair tied up in a ponytail. The deck has a railing with vertical bars, and there are a few chairs and a grill to the right side of the frame.
2) She starts by applying shaving cream to her legs, covering them thoroughly, which causes the hairs to be lubricated and ready for shaving.
3) Then she begins to shave her legs, starting from the ankle and moving upwards, causing the removal of unwanted hair.
4) She bends down slightly to reach different areas of her legs, enabling her to access and shave all parts of her leg.
5) After shaving one leg, she sits down on a chair and continues to shave her other leg, allowing her to comfortably finish the task.
6) She then stands up again to finish shaving the remaining parts of her legs, ensuring that all areas are properly shaved.
