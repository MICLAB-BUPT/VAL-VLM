1) The man, dressed in a light green t-shirt and black shorts, walks into the netted area, which is set up for discus throwing.
2) He then steps into the circle at the center of the netted area, indicating the start of his throw.
3) The man begins to spin with the discus in hand, gradually increasing his speed, which causes him to build momentum.
4) As he spins, he swings his arm back and forth, further preparing his body for the release of the discus.
5) The built-up momentum from spinning and the arm swing action cause him to finally release the discus with a powerful throw, sending it flying through the air.
