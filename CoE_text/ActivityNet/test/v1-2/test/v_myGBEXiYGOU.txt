1) The video shows a woman painting on a canvas, which causes her to be standing in front of the canvas, holding a paintbrush in her right hand.
2) She starts by drawing the outline of a peacock with blue paint, which leads to the creation of a bird-like figure with a long neck and tail feathers.
3) After outlining, she adds details and colors to the feathers, causing the use of various shades of blue and yellow to create depth and texture.
4) The woman is focused and precise in her movements, which results in carefully applying each stroke to bring the peacock to life and creating smooth and even strokes.
