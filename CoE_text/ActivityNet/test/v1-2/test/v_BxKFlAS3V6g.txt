1) The person, who is a young girl wearing a black and white sweater and pajama pants, is chopping wood with an axe in a snowy outdoor setting.
2) The girl's action of raising the axe above her head and bringing it down on a log causes the logs to split into smaller pieces.
3) The presence of a pile of chopped wood behind her indicates that the repeated action of swinging the axe has resulted in a collection of successfully split logs.
4) A man standing behind the girl watching suggests that he might be there for supervision or support, which could cause the girl to feel more confident or careful while performing the task.
