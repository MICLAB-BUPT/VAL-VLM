1) The video starts with a title screen that reads 'Drinking Beer With A Straw' and 'a 'quick' lesson to a younger...' against a black background, which causes the viewer to anticipate a drinking challenge.
2) It then transitions to two men standing in front of a curtain, one wearing a pink shirt and the other in a beige shirt with 'New Zealand' written on it, indicating their readiness for the challenge.
3) They are holding green bottles, presumably beer, and appear to be preparing for a drinking challenge, causing the man in the pink shirt to insert a straw into his bottle while the man in the beige shirt watches and talks to him.
4) They both drink from their bottles simultaneously, with the man in the pink shirt struggling slightly, leading to text overlays such as 'A little cocky?' and 'NZ: 8.05 SEC' appearing during the video, suggesting some form of scoring or commentary.
5) The video ends with a black screen displaying the text 'This featured: Josh Raisun (winner) Simon Edwards (younger)', indicating the conclusion of the challenge and the winner.
