1) The video shows a man in a bar setting, wearing a black shirt with red patterns.
2) He is seen holding a bottle of liquor and pouring it into a shot glass placed on top of a metallic object, which could be a shaker or a stand.
3) The man then adds another liquid from a different bottle, creating a layered effect in the shot glass, ensuring it doesn't mix with the first. The first liquid is clear and comes from a bottle with a golden cap, while the second one is red.
4) After adding the second liquid, he places the shot glass back on the metallic object.
5) The man uses a spoon to stir the contents of the shot glass, mixing the two liquids together.
6) Finally, he lights the shot glass with a lighter, causing a small flame to appear at the top of the glass, which illuminates the surrounding area.
