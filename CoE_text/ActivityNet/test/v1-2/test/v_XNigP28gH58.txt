1) The video shows a woman in a kitchen setting, standing behind an ironing board, wearing a black shirt with her hair tied back, and holding a can of spray starch and an iron.
2) She begins by spraying the starch onto a blue shirt (or a piece of fabric) laid out on the ironing board, which causes the material to become damp and ready for pressing.
3) Then, she uses the iron to press the shirt (or fabric), smoothing out any wrinkles, which is done to ensure the item is wrinkle-free.
4) She continues to iron different sections of the shirt (or moves the iron back and forth across the surface of the fabric), ensuring thorough coverage and that all areas are smoothed, which contributes to achieving a perfectly pressed result.
5) After ironing, she lifts the fabric to check for any remaining wrinkles, which allows her to confirm the effectiveness of her ironing and to identify any areas that may need further attention.
