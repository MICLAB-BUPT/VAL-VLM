1) The man in a white shirt and black shorts stands on a concrete platform, preparing to throw a hammer.
2) He starts swinging the hammer around his body, which causes him to gradually increase the speed of the swing.
3) As he swings the hammer, he rotates his body along with it, building momentum.
4) After several rotations, the built-up momentum causes him to release the hammer with a powerful throw.
5) The hammer flies through the air and lands outside of the frame, causing the man to watch its trajectory.
6) Satisfied with his performance, the man then walks off the platform.
