1) The video shows a woman in a red tank top and shorts using an elliptical machine, which causes the viewer to focus on her and the exercise equipment.
2) Because she is pedaling at a steady pace with her arms moving back and forth, it simulates a running motion while she is on the machine.
3) The camera's focus on her legs and upper body as she exercises highlights the movement of her muscles and the mechanics of the elliptical machine, which is made possible by the plain white background that puts the emphasis entirely on the woman and the equipment.
