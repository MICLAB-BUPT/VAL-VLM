1) The person, dressed in a black jacket and blue jeans, begins shoveling snow from the driveway, which causes the clearing of the snow-covered area.
2) The action of shoveling snow by the person leads to the continuous movement back and forth along the driveway, further causing the gradual exposure of the driveway surface.
3) The presence of the dog, running around and playing in the snow, does not interrupt the person's task, allowing the individual to continue shoveling, which in turn results in the ongoing progress of snow removal.
4) The person's occasional stops to look at the dog do not prevent them from resuming their shoveling, ensuring that the task of clearing the driveway of snow continues until the video ends.
