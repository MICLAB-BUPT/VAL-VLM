1) The video begins with a title screen displaying "Kudda.com Presents" over an image of a basketball on a court, which causes the scene to transition to a gymnasium.
2) In the gymnasium, two individuals are present, one of whom is a young man in a black t-shirt and shorts holding a basketball, and the other is a coach or observer standing nearby, which leads to the start of a basketball drill.
3) The person with the ball starts performing a reverse Mikan drill, moving back and forth between the left and right sides of the basket while shooting, which allows the demonstration of his technique and form multiple times.
4) The coach observes and provides guidance throughout the drill, which contributes to the improvement and correctness of the performer's technique.
5) The video concludes with another title screen showing "See More Free Videos @ Kudda.com" over an image of a basketball on the court, which is caused by the completion of the demonstrated drill.
