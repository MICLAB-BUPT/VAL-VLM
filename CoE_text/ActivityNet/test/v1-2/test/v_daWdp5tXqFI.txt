2) She throws the balloon into the air, and it lands on the ground, causing a man in a striped shirt walking by to pick up the balloon and hand it back to her.
3) They both enter the building through a door, which leads them to a living room where they sit on a couch, with the girl holding the balloon and the man smoking a cigarette.
4) The girl tosses the balloon in the air, and it falls to the floor, while the man continues to smoke, seemingly oblivious to her actions.

6) The girl is seen standing on the couch, looking down at the balloon, and then the video ends with a close-up of the girl's face as she looks at the camera.
