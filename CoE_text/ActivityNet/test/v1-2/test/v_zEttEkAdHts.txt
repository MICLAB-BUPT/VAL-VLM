1) The video begins with a black screen that transitions to a close-up of various colorful gift wrapping papers, causing the introduction of the alternative method for gift wrapping.
2) Text appears on the screen, 'Why spend your hard-earned dollars buying gift wrap... when you can wrap your gifts in dollars?' which leads to the presentation of the main idea of the video - using dollar bills as gift wrap.
3) An image of a stack of dollar bills is shown, reinforcing the concept introduced, and then two tape dispensers labeled Scotch and masking tape, with a red 'X' over them, are displayed, indicating they are not recommended for this particular wrapping method.
4) A box of chocolate is shown with the text 'Select a gift,' prompting the selection of an item to be wrapped, which causes the demonstration to proceed.
5) A hand places dollar bills on top of the box, covering it completely, leading to the next step of the wrapping process.
6) The hand then folds the edges of the dollar bills over the box, creating a makeshift gift wrap, which results in the securement of the dollar bills around the gift.
7) The person tapes down the folded edges to secure the wrapping, ensuring the dollar bills stay in place, thus completing the gift-wrapping process.
8) The video concludes with a wrapped gift adorned with a green ribbon, along with text overlays reading 'Video Big Island,' 'Music by Luis Marzans,' and 'Happy Holidays!' providing credits and well wishes, which ends the instructional segment.
