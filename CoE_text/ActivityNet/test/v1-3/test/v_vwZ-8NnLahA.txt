1) A young girl in a green top and yellow-striped skirt is playing on a playground.
2) She starts by standing on a platform, then jumps up to grab onto a green pole, which causes her to begin engaging with the play structure.
3) She swings her legs over the pole and hangs from it with both hands, allowing her to position herself for further movement.
4) She then lets go of one hand and reaches out to grab another pole, swinging her body around it, which leads to an increase in her momentum.
5) The girl continues to swing back and forth between the two poles, using her momentum to propel herself forward, indicating that she has successfully transitioned from struggling to climb to confidently navigating the monkey bars.
