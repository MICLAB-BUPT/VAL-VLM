1) A woman in a purple and white shirt, blue shorts, and sneakers is demonstrating a knee exercise in a gym. She starts by sitting on a bench with her feet flat on the floor.
2) This causes her to then stand up and step onto a blue mat.
3) Once on the mat, she kneels down on one knee while holding a red bar for support, which allows her to perform a series of movements, including extending her arms forward, pulling them back towards her chest, and rotating her upper body from side to side.
4) The action of stepping onto the blue mat also leads to her performing lunges while still holding onto the red bar for support, emphasizing proper form and technique throughout.
5) Throughout the routine, she demonstrates correct posture and muscle engagement, integrating the initial knee exercises with the subsequent lunge movements.
