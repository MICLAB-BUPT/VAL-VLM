1) The video shows a group of young fencers practicing in a gymnasium, which causes them to be dressed in white fencing uniforms, masks, and gloves, with protective gear on their legs.
2) Each fencer holds an épée, a type of fencing sword, enabling them to engage in various fencing exercises such as lunges, parries, and retreats.
3) The gym has wooden floors marked for sports, and there's a long wooden bench in the center, providing a suitable and organized space for the fencers to practice and rest.
4) The walls are light-colored, and there are no windows visible, which, combined with the bright and even lighting likely from overhead fluorescent lights, ensures that the entire space is well-illuminated for clear visibility during the training session.
5) The fencers move around the space, practicing their footwork and swordplay techniques, which leads to some sparring while others observe or wait for their turn, creating a focused and disciplined atmosphere typical of a training session.
