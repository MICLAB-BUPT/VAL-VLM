1) The video begins with a man in a striped sweater and pajama pants assembling a black artificial Christmas tree, which causes him to cut the cardboard box that the tree came in.
2) After cutting the box, he attaches the tree to its stand, which causes the woman in a red sweater and plaid skirt to assist him by handing him tools and materials.
3) They work together to assemble the tree, ensuring it stands upright, which leads to them beginning to decorate the tree with silver ornaments.
4) The man hangs the ornaments on the higher branches while the woman focuses on the lower ones, which ensures the ornaments are evenly distributed on the tree.
5) The man uses a screwdriver to assemble the tree, and after the tree is assembled, they attach black tinsel to the tree, followed by silver ornaments.
6) Once the tree is fully decorated, it stands next to a white radiator, with wrapped presents placed at its base.
