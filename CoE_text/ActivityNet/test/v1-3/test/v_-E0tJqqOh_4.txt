1) The video begins with a close-up shot of a slice of chocolate cake on a plate, followed by a list of ingredients for the cake and icing.
2) The person starts by melting butter in a bowl, which causes the preparation of the base for the cake to commence.
3) Condensed milk is added to the melted butter and mixed well, enhancing the richness and sweetness of the cake.
4) Flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and soda bicarbonate are sifted into the mixture, ensuring that there are no lumps and the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which leads to a smoother batter.
5) The mixture is stirred until smooth, resulting in a consistent batter ready for baking.
6) The batter is poured into an aluminum tin, setting it up for the baking process.
7) The oven, preheated to 150 degrees Celsius, bakes the cake for 30-40 minutes, causing the transformation from raw batter to a fully baked cake.
8) After baking, the cake is removed from the oven and allowed to cool, enabling the structure of the cake to set properly.
9) Chocolate is melted with hot milk and stirred until smooth, creating a spreadable icing for the cake.
10) The cooled cake is sliced into two halves, allowing for the addition of filling or layering.
11) The chocolate mixture is spread on one half of the cake, adding flavor and moisture to the interior of the cake.
12) The other half of the cake is placed on top, and the entire cake is then covered with the chocolate icing, leading to a beautifully decorated and finished chocolate cake.
