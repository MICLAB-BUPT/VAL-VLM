1) The video starts with a man standing behind a wooden table in a dimly lit room, which causes the viewer's attention to be focused on the man and the table.
2) On the table, there are two objects: a blue cup and a bottle of mouthwash, which indicates that the man is preparing for an activity involving these items.
3) The man begins his demonstration, and text overlays such as 'Step 1' and 'Step 2' appear on the screen, which guides the viewer through the process he is about to demonstrate.
4) He pours the mouthwash from the bottle into the blue cup, which is a part of the steps he is demonstrating.
5) The man then drinks from the cup, which completes the activity he was preparing for and demonstrating.
