1) The video shows a group of people gathered in an outdoor setting, possibly a park or open field, which causes the environment to have trees and grass visible, suggesting a natural, outdoor location.
2) A man, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, is blindfolded and holding a stick or baton, which leads to him attempting to hit a target, specifically a piñata shaped like a bear that is hanging from a tree branch.
3) The other individuals in the scene are watching and cheering him on, which encourages the blindfolded man to swing the stick multiple times, trying to hit the piñata.
4) Despite his efforts, he misses the piñata each time, but this does not diminish the support and cheers from the people watching.
