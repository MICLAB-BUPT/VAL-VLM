1) The video begins with a close-up of two small bottles labeled 'Bella' on a wooden surface, with the text 'Contact lenses' displayed above them.
2) A hand picks up one bottle, revealing the brand name 'GEO Bella' and the model number 'BS-205', and opens it to show the contact lens inside, causing the scene to transition to a pair of green cases being placed next to the bottles.
3) The hand uses tweezers to remove the contact lens from the bottle and places it into one of the green cases, which leads to the demonstration of how to handle the lens using a cotton bud.
4) The person then demonstrates how to deposit the lens by placing it onto the cotton bud and then into the case, leading to the next step of putting the lens in by holding the index finger up and placing the lens on the fingertip.
5) Looking into a mirror, the person gently places the lens onto their eye and adjusts it for comfort, resulting in a successful placement of the contact lens.
6) Finally, the video shows the person removing the lens using the cotton bud and placing it back into the bottle, concluding the demonstration.
