1) The video features a person in a workshop setting, demonstrating the process of waxing skis. The individual is wearing a dark t-shirt with 'Nordica' branding and a beanie, and they are working on a pair of skis clamped to a workbench. The environment includes various tools and ski maintenance equipment scattered around.
2) The man uses a blue waxing iron to apply wax to the skis, moving it back and forth along the length of the ski, which causes the wax to melt and spread over the base of the skis.
3) After applying the wax, he uses a brush to spread it evenly across the surface, ensuring that the wax covers the entire base and fills any imperfections, which prepares the skis for the next step.
4) He then picks up a blue device, possibly a sander or polisher, and begins working on the black object (the ski), using the device to smooth out the surface of the object, moving it back and forth with precision, which polishes the waxed surface and ensures an even finish.
5) After finishing with the device, he steps back from the workbench, seemingly satisfied with his work, indicating the completion of the ski waxing and polishing process.
