1) The video showcases a series of rodeo events where cowboys are seen riding horses and roping calves.
2) Dressed in cowboy hats, jeans, and boots, the cowboys demonstrate their skills by swinging ropes to catch the calves, which causes the lasso to successfully loop around the calf.
3) After successfully roping the calf, the cowboy dismounts from the horse, which leads to him approaching the calf on foot.
4) The cowboy then ties the calf's legs together, resulting in the calf being immobilized on the ground.
5) Following this, the cowboy stands up and walks away, leaving the tied calf behind, thus completing the sequence of the rodeo event.
