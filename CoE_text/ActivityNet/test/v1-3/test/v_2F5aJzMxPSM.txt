1) A young boy, wearing a teal t-shirt, is seated at a table in a room with a neutral color scheme and a door and speaker in the background, attempting to solve a Rubik's Cube.
2) The boy manipulates the cube with both hands, showing various stages of solving it, with his focus remaining on the cube throughout, and occasionally pauses to adjust his grip or reposition the cube.
3) After several attempts, he successfully solves the puzzle, which causes him to place the solved Rubik's Cube down on the table.
4) He then picks up a timer device, which displays the time taken to solve the cube, reading '16.06', indicating the completion of the task.
