1) The video begins with a close-up of a person's hands, which are noticeable for their pink nail polish and a nose ring, holding a contact lens case.
2) The person opens the lens case, revealing a contact lens, and applies a drop of solution from a bottle labeled 'RevitaLens ocellus Multi-Purpose Disinfecting Solution' onto the lens, causing it to be properly lubricated and disinfected for use.
3) After placing the first red contact lens on their finger, the person proceeds to insert it into their eye, adjusting it for comfort, which leads to them looking at the camera, indicating successful placement.
4) This process is then repeated with another contact lens, this time blue in color, as the person places, adjusts, and confirms its position in their eye, demonstrating the procedure for both eyes.
5) Finally, the person removes each contact lens by pinching them off their fingers, showing the lenses in their hand before placing them back into the case, thereby completing the cycle of handling, inserting, and storing the contact lenses.
