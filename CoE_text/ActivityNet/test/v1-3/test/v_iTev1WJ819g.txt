3) Her actions in the mall lead her to move to a grocery store, where she browses through aisles filled with food items.
4) After the grocery store, she continues her shopping spree, visiting different stores and examining products, which includes trying on shoes in a store.
5) The completion of her shoe fitting then results in her walking outside and back into another store for further browsing.
