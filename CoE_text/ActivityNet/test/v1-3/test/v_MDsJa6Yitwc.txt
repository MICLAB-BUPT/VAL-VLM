1) The man, dressed in a white sweatshirt and gray pants, is painting the walls of a room, which causes him to use a paint roller for the task.
2) He starts from the top corner and moves downwards, causing him to stand on a ladder to reach the higher parts of the wall.
3) To apply the paint evenly across the wall, he carefully moves the roller up and down, ensuring all areas are covered, which results in an even coat of paint.
4) The man uses a tray to hold the paint, making it easier for him to dip the roller and get more paint, which contributes to the efficiency and neatness of his work.
