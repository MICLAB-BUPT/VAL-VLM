1) The woman is in a dark blue hoodie with 'SAINTS' written on it and jeans, standing outdoors against a backdrop of autumn trees and a lake, which causes the setting to be serene and seasonally appropriate for raking leaves.
2) The environment is filled with fallen leaves covering the ground, and the trees have yellow and orange foliage, indicating it's fall, which leads to the necessity of yard work such as raking leaves.
3) The woman is holding a green rake and appears to be demonstrating how to rake leaves, which results in her moving the rake back and forth to gather the fallen leaves.
4) She is wearing gloves and is seen raking the leaves into piles, occasionally pausing to explain or demonstrate something, which suggests that she is not only engaged in yard work but also teaching others how to do it.
5) The lighting suggests it's daytime with natural sunlight filtering through the trees, which provides good visibility and conditions for the woman to perform and demonstrate the task effectively.
