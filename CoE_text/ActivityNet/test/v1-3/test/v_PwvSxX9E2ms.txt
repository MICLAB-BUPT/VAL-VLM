1) The video starts with a close-up of cookie dough balls in a yellow bowl, followed by text indicating the recipe is for no-bake chocolate bites.
2) This introduction causes the display of ingredients: butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and salt.
3) The person then begins mixing the butter and sugars, which leads to the addition of flour and chocolate chips into the mixture.
4) Thorough mixing of these ingredients results in a well-combined dough, ready for shaping.
5) The dough is formed into small balls, and this action causes the placement of these balls on a baking sheet.
6) Although the first answer mentions baking until golden brown, the second answer clarifies that the video actually prepares the dough balls for what would be a no-bake process, indicating the final step shown is the preparation of the dough balls for setting, not baking.
