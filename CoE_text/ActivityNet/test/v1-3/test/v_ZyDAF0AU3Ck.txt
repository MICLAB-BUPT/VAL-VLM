1) The video takes place in an indoor rodeo arena at night, illuminated by artificial lighting.
2) A cowboy on horseback, wearing a cowboy hat, jeans, and boots, chases a white with brown patches calf across the dirt floor, which causes dust to rise from the ground.
3) As the cowboy approaches the calf, he throws a lasso, successfully catching it around the neck, causing him to dismount his horse.
4) The dismounting of the horse causes the cowboy to run towards the calf to wrestle it to the ground.
5) After wrestling the calf to the ground, the action of pinning the calf down causes the cowboy to tie its legs together.
6) Throughout these actions, the horse, which is brown with a white blaze on its face, remains standing nearby, tethered to the calf by the lasso.
