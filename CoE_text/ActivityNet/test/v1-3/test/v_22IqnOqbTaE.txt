1) The man is wearing a white shirt and pants, which cause him to be easily identifiable in the video as he works.
2) The presence of a long-handled tool causes the man to be able to reach and scrape off old paint from the brick wall effectively.
3) The fact that the wall is partially stripped of its previous layer, revealing the red bricks underneath, indicates that the scraping process has been ongoing, causing the visible progress on the wall.
4) The large windows allowing natural light to enter the room cause the work area to be well-illuminated, making it easier for the man to see and remove the remaining paint.
5) The partial coverage of yellow paint on the wall with a brick pattern, along with the window on the left side and the door on the right side, sets the scene where the man is working, causing a clear visual context of his activity.
