1) The man in the video is spray painting a metal table, which causes him to wear black gloves for protection.
2) He starts by spraying the underside of the table with a light green color, ensuring even coverage, which then leads him to move on to the top side of the table to continue the spray painting process.
3) The use of a green spray can and the bright lighting in the workshop setting cause the vibrant green paint and the metallic sheen of the table to be highlighted.
