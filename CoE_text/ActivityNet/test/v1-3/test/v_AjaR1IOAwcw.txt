1) A person wearing a red helmet, black shorts, and a white tank top is trimming a tall hedge using an electric hedge trimmer, which causes the hedge to be methodically cut down to a shorter height.
2) The individual, who is also carrying a backpack with a motorized hedge trimmer, moves along the side of a road, which leads to him carefully shaping the hedge to maintain its uniform appearance.
3) The dense and green hedge covering the entire background of the scene, when being trimmed, results in the man occasionally pausing to adjust his position or to more precisely trim specific areas.
