1) The video shows a person with long hair, wearing a camouflage jacket and orange gloves, in an outdoor garden or farm setting.
2) This person is seen kneeling on the ground next to a small tree, which causes them to be in a position to work closely with the tree's base.
3) They begin by using their hands to dig around the base of the tree, which is likely done to loosen the soil or prepare it for mulching.
4) After digging, the person gathers a large pile of straw or hay, causing them to have the necessary material to place around the base of the tree.
5) The action of placing the straw or hay around the base of the tree serves as a form of mulch, which in turn retains moisture and protects the tree's roots.
