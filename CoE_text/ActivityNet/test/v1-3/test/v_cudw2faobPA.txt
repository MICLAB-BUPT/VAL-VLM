1) The video showcases the process of carving a pumpkin, which begins with a person drawing a face on the pumpkin using a black marker.
2) This drawing causes the individual to have a clear guideline for where to cut, after which they proceed to cut out the top and scoop out the insides, removing the seeds and pulp.
3) After cleaning the pumpkin, the person places a piece of paper with a drawn face onto the pumpkin, causing them to be able to use a fork to poke holes along the outline, thus creating a more precise template for carving.
4) The removal of the paper then allows the individual to carve out the shapes with a knife, following the holes poked, resulting in the creation of the eyes, nose, and mouth of the jack-o'-lantern.
5) Finally, placing and lighting a candle inside the carved pumpkin causes it to glow brightly, illuminating the carved face against a dark background.
