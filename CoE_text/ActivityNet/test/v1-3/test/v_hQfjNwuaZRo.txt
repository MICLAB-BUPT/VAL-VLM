1) A person is seen spraying a cleaning solution onto the roof tiles using a hose, methodically moving the hose back and forth to ensure all areas of the roof are covered. This action is taken to prepare the surface for cleaning.
2) The video then shows the same person cleaning the roof using a pressure washer. This step is caused by the need to remove the dirt and grime that has been loosened by the cleaning solution.
3) As the pressure washer is used, the dirt is visibly removed, revealing cleaner shingles underneath, which is the result of the combined effect of the cleaning solution and the pressure washing.
