1) The video begins with a title screen, setting the stage for a family-friendly activity, which causes the viewer to anticipate an engaging and creative project.
2) A person's hands are shown removing the lid from a cardboard box, which is the initial step in the process of making a pretend cake, leading to the marking and cutting of the box into four equal segments.
3) Cutting the cardboard into segments and trimming the edges prepares the base structure of the cake, causing the next steps of measuring and cutting strips of cardboard to form the segments.
4) Gluing the cardboard strips to form segments and attaching the lid pieces, along with trimming any rough edges, creates a more defined shape for the pretend cake, which leads to the application of paint.
5) The person mixes colors to make chocolate brown paint and applies it, allowing the base color to dry, which then enables the painting of the other end of the segments and the marking of a line halfway around the center.
6) Mixing paint with plaster to create a thick paste and applying it following the marked line enhances the texture and appearance of the cake, leading to the painting of the top of the cake with ice blue paint.
7) Sprinkling pink and white beads on the cake and using mod podge to seal it adds the final decorative touches, completing the transformation of the cardboard into a visually appealing pretend cake.
