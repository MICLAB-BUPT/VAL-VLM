1) The video begins with a title screen that reads "How to set up a Fixed Football Table from Outdoor Leisure Direct," which causes it to transition to a scene showing various parts of a football table laid out on the floor.
2) Showing the parts of the football table laid out leads to the next sequence, which is the assembly process, starting with attaching the legs to the sides of the table, followed by placing the playing surface onto the frame.
3) After the playing surface is placed onto the frame, the video continues with the installation of the corner posts and the backboard, which features a soccer ball design.
4) The completion of installing the corner posts and the backboard results in the final scenes depicting the fully assembled football table, complete with players and goalposts, ready for play.
5) The readiness of the fully assembled football table then causes the video to show a man and a woman playing foosball on it, actively engaging in the game, moving the rods to control the players, and attempting to score goals.
