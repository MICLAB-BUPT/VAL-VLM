1) The man is painting a fence in his backyard, which causes him to use a paint sprayer for the task.
2) He is wearing a white shirt and khaki (beige) pants, causing him to be appropriately dressed for the painting activity.
3) The fence, made of wood, is partially painted red, but the man's current action of using white paint from the spray gun causes the fence to start changing its color from red to white.
4) The man starts by spraying the lower part of the fence and then moves upwards, which causes an even coverage of paint on the fence.
5) His focus on the task and the movement of the sprayer back and forth cause a thorough and uniform application of paint.
