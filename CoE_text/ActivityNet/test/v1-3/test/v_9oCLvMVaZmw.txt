1) The video showcases a person sharpening a knife, initially using a honing steel. The individual, wearing a black shirt and a name tag, holds the honing steel in one hand and the knife in the other, sliding the knife along the steel at an angle to ensure even sharpening.
2) After using the honing steel, the person then uses a sharpening stone to further refine the edge of the knife, holding the knife in one hand and moving it back and forth along the stone.
3) The effectiveness of the sharpening process, caused by the use of both the honing steel and the sharpening stone, is demonstrated when the person tests the sharpness of the knife by cutting through their arm.
