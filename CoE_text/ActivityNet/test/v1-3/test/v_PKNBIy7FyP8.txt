1) The presence of a thick layer of brown leaves on the ground, along with the surrounding trees with autumn foliage, indicates that it is fall season, which causes the need for yard maintenance.
2) To address the fallen leaves and keep the yard tidy, two individuals decide to use leaf blowers, leading them to start the task of clearing the lawn.
3) As they work, the two people methodically move around the yard, directing their leaf blowers towards the center, which causes the leaves to be gathered into a pile.
4) The action of blowing the leaves creates a dynamic visual effect, with leaves swirling and scattering in the air, as a result of the force from the leaf blowers.
