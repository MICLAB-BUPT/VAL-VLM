1) The video begins with a person holding two grooming tools, one in each hand, while standing next to a large, fluffy dog lying on the ground.
2) The person then starts brushing the dog's fur using the grooming tool in their right hand, which causes the dog to remain calm and still throughout the grooming process.
3) The person continues to brush the dog's fur, moving the brush back and forth across the dog's body, causing the dog to appear relaxed and content during the session.
4) After some time, the person switches to using the yellow comb (the grooming tool in their left hand), continuing to groom the dog's coat, and this action also keeps the dog calm and still, enjoying the grooming session.
5) The person uses their hands to gently massage and pet the dog while grooming, further contributing to the dog's relaxed state.
6) Finally, the person puts down the grooming tool and pets the dog gently, leading to the dog sitting up and looking at the camera as the video ends.
