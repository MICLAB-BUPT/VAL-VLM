1) The video begins with a man in an orange vest standing on a dirt road, gesturing towards the camera, and he is accompanied by another person who is working on a flat tire of a black SUV. This setup indicates that the man in the orange vest is likely providing instructions or explanations to the other person.
2) The man in the red shirt and yellow vest, who is working on the flat tire, uses a tool to remove the lug nuts, which is necessary to change the tire. This action is caused by the need to replace the flat tire with a spare one.
3) After the lug nuts are loosened, the man in the red shirt removes the old tire from the vehicle, a step that is essential for replacing it with a new one.
4) The man in the orange vest assists him by holding the spare tire in place, which helps in aligning the spare tire correctly onto the wheel hub.
5) The man in the red shirt then secures the new tire by tightening the lug nuts using the tire iron, ensuring that the spare tire is firmly attached to the vehicle.
6) Finally, the man in the red shirt checks the air pressure of the spare tire to ensure it is properly inflated, a safety measure that is crucial before driving the car. This final check is caused by the need to confirm that the newly installed tire is safe and ready for use.
