1) The video showcases a person playing pool in an indoor setting, where the player, dressed in a striped shirt and jeans, is seen taking shots at the billiard balls on a green pool table with wooden edges, causing the balls to move in various directions after being struck by the cue stick.
2) The balls are arranged in a triangular formation at one end of the table, which allows the player to use a cue stick to strike the white cue ball, aiming to pocket other colored balls scattered across the table, thereby demonstrating skill and concentration as they take several shots and move around the table to position themselves for each shot.
3) The background features another individual standing near a bar counter, observing the game, and the lighting is dim, creating a focused atmosphere on the pool table, which further highlights the deliberate and calculated movements of the player.
