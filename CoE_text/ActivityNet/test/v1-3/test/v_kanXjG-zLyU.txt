1) The person starts by placing various baking tools and ingredients, including flour, sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla extract, milk, and a bag of Truvia Baking Blend, on a white marble countertop, which is the initial step to prepare for making cookies.
2) Using an electric mixer, the person creams the butter and sugar together until smooth, causing a well-blended base for the cookie dough.
3) Eggs, vanilla extract, and milk are then added to the mixture and beaten in, further enriching the flavor and consistency of the dough.
4) The addition of dry ingredients like flour and baking powder to the wet mixture, and mixing them together using a hand mixer, causes the formation of the complete cookie dough.
5) The dough is transferred to a floured surface, kneaded into a ball, wrapped in plastic wrap, and chilled in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, which makes the dough easier to handle and prevents it from spreading too much during baking.
6) After chilling, the dough is rolled out on a floured surface and cut into shapes using cookie cutters, leading to the creation of individual cookie shapes ready for baking.
7) The shaped cookies are placed on a baking sheet and baked in the oven at 350°F for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned, resulting in fully baked cookies.
8) Finally, the baked cookies are decorated with green and white icing and sprinkles, giving the final product a festive and appealing look.
