1) The scene takes place in a dimly lit room with warm tones, where a person wearing a white long-sleeve shirt and blue jeans is standing near a dartboard mounted on the wall. The room appears to be a living space, with a bookshelf filled with books, a desk with papers, a red jacket draped over a chair, and a floor lamp providing some light.

3) The man then throws darts at the dartboard, fulfilling his intention to play.
4) After throwing the darts, he turns around and walks away from the dartboard, suggesting that the game or practice session has concluded.
