1) The person, wearing a green shirt and beige pants, lies on their back on a black exercise mat in a room with red walls, white baseboards, and two windows with partially open blinds that allow natural light to enter, causing the space to be well-lit.
2) To perform an abdominal exercise, the person lifts their upper body off the mat, keeping their legs bent at the knees and feet flat on the floor, which causes engagement of the abdominal muscles.
3) The person's hands are placed behind their head, supporting their neck, as they execute controlled and deliberate movements, which is done to maintain proper form during the exercise.
4) The action of lifting the upper body towards the knees, while keeping the hands behind the head, is identified as performing sit-ups, which aims to strengthen the abdominal muscles.
