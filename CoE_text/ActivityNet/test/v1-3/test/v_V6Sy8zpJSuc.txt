1) The man unrolls a black carpet subfloor material in an empty room with white walls and a gray floor, which causes the entire area to be covered by the subfloor.
2) He then applies red tape along the seams of the carpet, causing the subfloor material to be properly adhered.
3) Next, he installs a tack strip on top of the carpet subfloor, which prepares the surface for the carpet installation.
4) The man measures and cuts the carpet to fit the room's dimensions, ensuring a snug fit against the walls, which causes the carpet to match the size of the room.
5) Finally, he lays down a purple carpet pad and places a gray carpet over it, securing it with a blue carpet stretcher tool, which results in the carpet being firmly in place.
