1) A person in a black and white athletic outfit is demonstrating an exercise in a well-lit gym with various fitness equipment, causing the environment to be conducive for a workout session.
2) The individual stands on a blue mat, holding onto a cable machine handle attached to a weight stack, which causes them to be prepared to perform a specific exercise.
3) The individual performs a series of movements by pulling the handle towards their chest while simultaneously extending one leg out to the side, maintaining balance and control throughout the exercise, which results in a full-body workout that engages multiple muscle groups.
4) The woman, dressed in a black shirt with white stripes and black pants, starts by standing on a blue mat, then kneels down while holding the cable attachment with both hands, leading to a change in her body position to target different muscles.
5) She proceeds to pull the cable towards her chest, engaging her triceps, ensuring that her elbows are tucked in close to her body, which causes her to focus specifically on strengthening her tricep muscles.
