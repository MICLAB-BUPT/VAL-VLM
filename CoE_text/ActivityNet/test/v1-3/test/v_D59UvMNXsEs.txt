1) A man wearing a white jacket and blue shorts is standing in front of a house, which causes him to be positioned on the lawn with a building (the house) in the background.
2) The man is holding a leaf blower with both hands, causing him to use it to blow leaves on the ground.
3) The presence of red and orange leaves indicates that it is autumn, which causes the need for the man to clear the fallen leaves from the lawn.
4) There is a red car parked in the driveway, which causes there to be a red car parked nearby as the man performs his task.
