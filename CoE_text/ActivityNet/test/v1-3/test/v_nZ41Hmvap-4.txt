1) The video shows two boys swinging on a swing set in a playground.
2) One boy is wearing a black shirt and blue jeans, while the other boy is wearing a shirt (the color of which is disputed between brown and gray) and shorts.
3) The boy in the black shirt falls off the swing, causing him to land on the ground.
4) The fall of the first boy does not cause the second boy to stop, and he continues to swing back and forth.
5) In one version, the video ends with a black screen displaying an advertisement for shoe lifts, suggesting a shift from the playground scene to a commercial message.
