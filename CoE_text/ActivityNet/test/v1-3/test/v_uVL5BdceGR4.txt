1) The man in a white shirt, dark overalls, and a cap measures the wall, which causes him to understand the dimensions needed for the wallpaper.
2) After measuring, he applies adhesive with a roller, causing the wall to become sticky and ready for the wallpaper to adhere.
3) He then carefully places the wallpaper onto the wall, causing the need to smooth it out with his hands and a red tool to ensure it is properly aligned and free of air bubbles.
4) To further ensure there are no air bubbles, he uses a brush, causing the wallpaper to be more securely and smoothly applied to the wall.
