1) The video features two individuals in a swimming pool, one wearing a green swim cap and goggles, the other in a patterned swimsuit (later specified as blue), engaged in a swimming lesson.
2) The person in the green cap is demonstrating a swimming technique while the other observes and provides guidance, which causes the observer to occasionally adjust the swimmer's form for correct execution of the stroke.
3) The environment is an indoor pool with clear water and light-colored walls, and the lighting is bright, likely from overhead artificial sources, which creates a calm and instructional setting.
4) The instructor uses hand gestures and verbal instructions to emphasize points about arm positioning and body alignment during the freestyle stroke, leading to the demonstration of various arm movements and body positions.
