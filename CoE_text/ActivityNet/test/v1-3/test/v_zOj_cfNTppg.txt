1) The video shows a group of people playing a game on a large white sheet with markings and numbers, which is laid out on the floor, causing the setting to be likely indoors, such as in a gymnasium.
2) The players are using sticks to push small black and yellow discs across the sheet, aiming for specific areas marked with numbers, which causes the objective of the game to be getting the discs as close to the target numbers as possible.
3) The game, appearing to be a variation of shuffleboard or a similar board game, involves strategy and skill, causing the players to carefully aim and control the movement of the discs as they take turns.
