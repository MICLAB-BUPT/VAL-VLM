1) The woman starts by cutting a circle around the stem of one pumpkin, causing the top part to be removable.
2) After removing the top part, she scoops out the seeds and pulp, which prepares the pumpkin for carving.
3) She then carves out two eyes, a nose, and a mouth on the pumpkin's surface, resulting in a carved face.
4) Upon finishing with one pumpkin, she moves on to another, repeating the process of cutting, scooping out the insides, and carving a face, leading to multiple pumpkins being decorated.
5) Throughout the process, she is surrounded by several lit pumpkins with already carved faces, and there are more uncarved pumpkins on the table, indicating that she has been engaged in this activity for some time.
