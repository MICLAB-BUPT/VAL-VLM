1) The video showcases a man in a workshop setting, wearing gloves and a white shirt, preparing to manufacture ski bases.
2) The man handles a large sheet of material with yellow stripes, which appears to be made of wood or a similar material, indicating the base for the ski.
3) He applies a liquid substance onto the base using a brush, ensuring even distribution, which is crucial for the quality of the final product.
4) To further ensure an even layer, the man uses a squeegee to smooth out the liquid, creating a glossy finish on the surface, enhancing the durability and performance of the ski base.
5) The man then places a white fabric-like material over the base, smoothing it out carefully, adding another layer that will contribute to the ski's properties.
6) Another layer of liquid substance is applied on top of the fabric by the man, making sure it's spread evenly, which helps in bonding the layers together.
7) Using a machine, the person presses down on the layered materials, setting them in place, a step necessary for the proper integration and solidification of the layers.
8) Finally, after completing all the steps, the man inspects the finished product, which now has a smooth surface, confirming the successful completion of the manufacturing process.
