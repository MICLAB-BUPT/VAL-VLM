1) The group of people prepares for their dive on the beach, adjusting their scuba gear and receiving instructions from a woman in a black and red wetsuit, which causes them to be ready for the underwater experience.
2) Wearing black wetsuits and yellow oxygen tanks, the divers enter the clear blue water, which allows them to begin their interactive diving experience with the dolphins.
3) The divers are seen kneeling on the ocean floor and interacting closely with the dolphins, feeding them and allowing the dolphins to swim around them, which creates a sense of connection with the marine life.
4) Engaging in playful activities, such as holding hands and swimming together with the dolphins, further enhances the excitement and wonder of this unique marine encounter.
