1) The video features a woman in a white top and black pants standing next to another woman seated on a green floral-patterned chair, causing the setting to be established as a well-lit room with a window covered by blinds, a lamp, and various skincare products visible on a table in the background.
2) The standing woman begins explaining the benefits and application process of a skincare product, which causes her to use hand gestures and hold a small white bottle, showing it to the camera.
3) The demonstration of the product's usage causes the standing woman to apply it first onto her own hand and then onto the face of the seated woman, who listens attentively and occasionally responds with nods or comments.
4) The continuous explanation and demonstration of the product's application and benefits cause the video to provide a detailed and engaging presentation for the viewers.
5) The conclusion of the video, featuring a logo for 'U and your skin' along with contact information, is caused by the completion of the product demonstration, thereby providing viewers with a way to get more information or purchase the product.
