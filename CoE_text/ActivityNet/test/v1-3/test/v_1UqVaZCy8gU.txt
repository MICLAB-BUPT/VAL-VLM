1) The presence of fallen leaves on the ground causes the indication that it is autumn.
2) The indication of autumn, along with the need for yard maintenance, causes the child to be engaged in using a leaf blower.
3) The child's engagement in using the leaf blower causes them to focus on clearing or moving the leaves around.
4) The task of clearing leaves, which is part of yard work, causes garden tools and a black trash bag to be visible in the background, suggesting ongoing or planned yard maintenance activities.
5) The natural lighting, possibly late afternoon, causes soft shadows, setting the time of day during which the child is performing this activity.
