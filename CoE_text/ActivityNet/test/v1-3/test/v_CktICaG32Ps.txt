1) The man, dressed in a white jacket and blue jeans, starts using a leaf blower to clear leaves from his yard.
2) He begins by blowing the leaves into a pile, which causes the leaves to gather in one spot.
3) The man then moves the leaves towards a pickup truck parked nearby, causing the leaves to be directed into the bed of the truck.
4) As he continues to blow the leaves, the bed of the truck gradually fills up, indicating the progress of his task.
5) At one point, he stops to adjust something on the leaf blower, possibly checking its functionality or making minor adjustments, which ensures the tool works properly.
6) After the adjustment, he resumes clearing the leaves, ensuring all areas of the yard are covered, which leads to all the leaves being collected in the truck.
