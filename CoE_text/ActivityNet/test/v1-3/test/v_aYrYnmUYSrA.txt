1) The woman in a striped top and grey leggings decides to perform hula hoop tricks at an outdoor festival, which causes her to start spinning the hoop around her waist, arms, and neck.
2) Her skillful performance and rhythmic movement to the music cause the atmosphere to become lively and festive, engaging the festival-goers in different activities such as dancing, sitting on chairs, and walking around.
3) The setting of the grassy field with trees, a white van parked nearby, and the presence of a stage with musicians playing instruments, along with a blue tent, contributes to the overall festive environment, which in turn causes the woman to smile and move her hips to keep the hoop spinning.
