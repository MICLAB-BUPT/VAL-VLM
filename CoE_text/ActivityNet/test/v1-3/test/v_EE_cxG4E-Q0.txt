1) The video begins with two women, Diane and her daughter, sitting at a table and knitting, which indicates that they are participants in the knitting class.
2) The focused and attentive manner of the two women as they work on their knitting projects causes the scene to shift to a close-up of the woman in the red sweater's hands, highlighting the detailed process of knitting.
3) The text appearing on the screen stating that Diane and her daughter are enrolled in the Expert Knitter Program at WEBS leads to a scene where the two women are standing in a yarn store, looking at a shelf filled with yarn, indicating that they are selecting materials for their projects.
4) The woman in the black sweater holding a piece of blue knitting and the woman in the red sweater pointing at something on the shelf suggests that they are discussing or deciding on the type of yarn to use, which then causes the scene to again focus on the hands of the woman in the red sweater as she continues knitting.
5) The next scene showing the two women sitting on a couch and looking at a tablet, with the woman in the black sweater holding a piece of orange knitting and the woman in the red sweater pointing at something on the tablet, implies that they are looking up knitting patterns or instructions, which is a common activity in a knitting class.
6) This action of consulting the tablet for patterns or instructions then results in another close-up of the woman in the red sweater's hands, emphasizing the ongoing nature of their knitting practice.
7) Finally, the two women standing in front of a display of yarn, looking at it, is caused by their engagement in the knitting class and their interest in exploring different types of yarns available, likely to enhance their skills and projects.
