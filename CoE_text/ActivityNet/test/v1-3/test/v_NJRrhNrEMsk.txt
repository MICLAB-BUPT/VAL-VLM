1) The video shows a person working on a tire in a garage, indicating the setting and the initial action.
2) The person uses a tool, specifically identified as a tire iron, to pry the tire off the rim, which is the method chosen for the task.
3) Bending down and applying force to the tire iron causes the tire to start separating from the rim.
4) They then use their hands to further pry the tire off the rim, complementing the use of the tool with manual effort.
5) This process, involving both the use of the tire iron and hand prying, is repeated several times, causing the tire to be completely removed from the rim.
6) Finally, they remove the tire from the rim and place it on the ground, concluding the series of actions.
