1) The man, dressed in a white protective suit and mask, is preparing to paint a wooden fence, which causes him to hold the spray gun with both hands.
2) To ensure an even coat of paint, he methodically moves the spray gun back and forth, causing the natural wood color of the fence to gradually become covered with gray paint.
3) To protect the ground from paint splatters, the man stands on a wooden board placed on the ground, which prevents the area around the fence from being stained.
