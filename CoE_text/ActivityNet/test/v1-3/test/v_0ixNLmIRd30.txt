1) A young man wearing a pink striped shirt and a black accessory (sleep mask or headband) is standing in front of a red wall with a BBC Oxford logo, holding a Rubik's Cube in his hands.
2) The fact that he is holding the Rubik's Cube causes him to start manipulating it, turning its sides rapidly as he attempts to solve the puzzle.
3) His manipulation of the cube, including twisting and turning to align the colors, leads to the eventual completion of the puzzle.
