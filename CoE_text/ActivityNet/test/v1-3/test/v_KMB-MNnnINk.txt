1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'GEO Color Nine Aqua' in pink cursive font, followed by an image of a blue and green circular object.
2) This causes the scene to transition to a close-up of two white contact lens cases containing green contact lenses, after which a person's hand is shown holding a small bottle labeled 'magic circle' with an orange and blue label.
3) The appearance of the person with teal-colored hair, stating their eyes are naturally brown, leads to them cleaning their fingers thoroughly, as indicated by the text 'Make sure your fingers are thoroughly cleaned...'.
4) After ensuring their fingers are clean, the person holds up a contact lens, showing its size and shape, with text overlay reading 'These lenses are 14.2mm...', causing them to then demonstrate how to insert the contact lens into their eye.
5) The demonstration of inserting the lens, where the color doesn't go all the way to the edge, results in the person carefully placing and adjusting the lens on their eye to ensure it is properly positioned, as they have green hair.
6) With the lens now in place, the person shows both eyes, one natural and one with the contact lens, commenting on the vibrant color, leading to them mentioning that the lenses are comfortable once settled.
7) Their positive experience with the lenses prompts them to recommend buying from Eye Candy's website for a reliable service.
8) Finally, the person removes the contact lens, waves goodbye, and the video concludes with text overlay saying 'Thanks for watching :)' and 'Tilly!', effectively ending the demonstration.
