1) The video shows a person preparing lemonade in a kitchen, which causes them to start the process by pouring water from a blue pitcher into a canister with a lemon design.
2) After pouring the initial water, the person fills the canister with more water from a sink faucet, causing the canister to be filled sufficiently.
3) To ensure the canister is completely filled, the person repeats the process of filling and pouring several times, leading to the next step where they stir the contents of the pitcher with a wooden spoon.
4) The stirring action, caused by the need to mix the lemonade ingredients properly, completes the preparation of the lemonade in a typical kitchen setting.
