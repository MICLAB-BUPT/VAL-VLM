1) The video starts with a title card displaying 'GREEN TEA LEMONADE' over an image of the drink, which causes the introduction of the woman in a teal top standing against a brick wall.
2) The woman's introduction to the topic, including text overlays about dehydration and water alternatives, leads to her showcasing a box of 'Green Tea' labeled as organic and whole leaf green tea.
3) Showcasing the tea box then causes her to shift the scene to holding a tea bag and boiling water on a stove.
4) Boiling the water leads to steeping the tea in a colorful mug.
5) After steeping the tea, she squeezes lime juice into it, which is followed by adding ice cubes.
6) Adding ice cubes then results in placing mint leaves on top for garnish.
7) The final product, presented in a glass with a straw and lime slice garnish, causes the woman to hold up the glass of green tea lemonade and smile at the camera.
8) Finally, the presentation of the drink leads to the promotional message for 'L'oreal True Match' foundation and a call to action for viewers to check out more content.
