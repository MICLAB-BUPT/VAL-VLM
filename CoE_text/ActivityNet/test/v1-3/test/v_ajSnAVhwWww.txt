3) A man is then seen laying down the tiles on a black surface, carefully aligning them to create a neat pattern, which is the start of the actual installation process.
4) The man's methodical approach, including kneeling and placing the tiles in a specific pattern while ensuring they fit snugly together, causes the creation of a seamless and uniform surface.
5) He continues to place tiles along the edge of the deck, ensuring they fit snugly, which further contributes to the overall aesthetic improvement.
6) The video concludes with a view of the completed deck, showcasing the uniform arrangement of the tiles and the overall aesthetic improvement, which is the result of the careful and precise installation process.
