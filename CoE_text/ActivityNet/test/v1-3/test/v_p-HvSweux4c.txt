1) The video begins with a woman in a bathroom setting, wearing a gray top and having long, wavy hair.
2) She starts by washing her hair with sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, which is the first step to prepare her hair for styling, causing it to be clean and ready for treatment.
3) Next, she applies a protein leave-in treatment to her wet hair, brushing it through thoroughly, an action that causes her hair to be nourished and protected, laying the foundation for achieving silky straight hair.
4) Then, she uses a professional ionic hair dryer, focusing on drying the roots first before moving down to the ends, a method that ensures even drying and helps avoid frizzing.
5) To manage and organize her hair during the drying process, she sections her hair with clips, allowing her to handle each section efficiently and dry it uniformly under the dryer.
6) With a high-quality ionic round brush, she wraps each section of her hair under the brush and dries it in one direction, a technique that contributes to the smoothness and straightness of her hair.
7) She then proceeds to dry the ends of her hair in a curling motion, a strategy aimed at hiding any split ends and adding a slight curve for a more polished look.
8) After all sections are dry, she styles her hair using a finishing gloss for extra shine, running her fingers through her hair to add volume and enhance the overall appearance, causing her hair to look shiny and full.
