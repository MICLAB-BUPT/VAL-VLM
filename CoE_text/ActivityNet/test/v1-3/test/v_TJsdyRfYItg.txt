1) The video begins with two people walking on a snowy surface towards a frozen lake, dressed in winter clothing, including jackets and boots.
2) As they approach the lake, one of them stops to inspect a hole in the ice, which causes the person to use a tool to remove a piece of ice from the hole, revealing a fishing line attached to it.
3) They lower the line into the water, waiting for a catch, which eventually leads to them pulling the line up, revealing a fish that has been caught.
4) The fish is then lifted out of the hole and placed on the snow-covered ground.
