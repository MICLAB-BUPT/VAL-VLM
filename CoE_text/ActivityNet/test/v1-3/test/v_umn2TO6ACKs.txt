1) A child, wearing a white t-shirt with red text, stands in front of a bathroom sink, which is white with a black faucet. The environment appears to be a home bathroom with neutral-colored walls and standard lighting.
2) The child is holding a bottle of mouthwash, which contains a blue liquid, and a small white cap, indicating that they are preparing to use the mouthwash.
3) The child unscrews the cap from the mouthwash bottle, causing the bottle to be ready for pouring.
4) After unscrewing, the child places the cap on the counter, which clears their hands for the next action.
5) The child then pours some mouthwash into their mouth, causing them to start the process of rinsing or gargling as part of their oral hygiene routine.
