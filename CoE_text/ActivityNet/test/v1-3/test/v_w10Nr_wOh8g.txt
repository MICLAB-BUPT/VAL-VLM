1) The video begins with a man in white overalls preparing to hang wallpaper on a wall.
2) He starts by unrolling the wallpaper and cutting it to size, which causes him to have appropriately sized pieces for the wall.
3) Then, he applies adhesive directly to the wall surface, causing the wallpaper to stick properly when applied.
4) He draws a plumb line at panel widths on the wall, which ensures that the first panel will be hung straight.
5) The man then hangs the first drop of wallpaper, smoothing it out with a brush or squeegee, which removes air bubbles and ensures a smooth application.
6) He works from the top down, allowing the wallpaper to fall naturally, which helps in achieving an even and professional-looking result.
7) When hanging multiple drops, he visually matches the image, ensuring that the pattern is continuous and aesthetically pleasing.
8) He trims away any excess paper at the top and bottom of each drop using a straight edge and a straight knife, which results in a neat and tidy appearance.
9) Once the entire length of the drop is lifted, he gently pulls away the thin strip from underneath, further refining the edges of the wallpaper.
10) Finally, he uses a seam roller to ensure the wallpaper is well adhered and free of air bubbles, which causes the final product to look seamless and professionally done.
