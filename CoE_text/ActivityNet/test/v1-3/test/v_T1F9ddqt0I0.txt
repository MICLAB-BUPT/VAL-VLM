1) The car is covered in a thick layer of ice, making it difficult to see through the windshield, which causes the person to need to clear the ice for visibility.
2) To address this, the person uses a red and black ice scraper to chip away at the ice, gradually clearing a path.
3) Additionally, the person uses a snow brush with a red handle and black bristles, moving it back and forth across the windshield, to further remove the ice and frost.
4) Wearing a blue jacket and standing outside in the snowy environment, the person continues to use both tools until the windshield is mostly cleared.
