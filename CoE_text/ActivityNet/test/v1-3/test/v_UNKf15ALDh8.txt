1) A woman, dressed in a white shirt, blue pants, and yellow gloves, is seen kneeling down next to a tree. This action is taken to prepare for the gardening activity of mulching.
2) She uses her hands to spread mulch around the base of the tree, ensuring it covers the soil evenly. The use of her hands allows for precise placement and adjustment of the mulch, which is crucial for maintaining the health of the tree.
3) The woman then stands up and uses a rake to further distribute the mulch, making sure it's evenly spread around the tree. Using the rake after hand placement helps in achieving an even layer of mulch, preventing any part of the tree's base from being left uncovered or over-mulched, thus supporting the tree's growth and health.
