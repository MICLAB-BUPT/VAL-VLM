1) The man wearing a blue shirt and black pants is mopping the floor of a public restroom, which causes him to move around the room.
2) As he moves around, he cleans different areas including the sink area, urinals, and the floor near the stalls, causing the restroom to become clean and well-maintained.
3) The use of a red mop by the man, as he methodically goes about his task, contributes to the thorough cleaning of the bathroom.
4) The presence of white walls, black and white checkered tiles on the floor, several sinks with mirrors above them, paper towel dispensers, and soap dispensers in the restroom, sets the scene where the man's actions take place.
