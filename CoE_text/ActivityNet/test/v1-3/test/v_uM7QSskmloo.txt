1) The man standing on a ladder, attaching a string to the top of a hedge, causes the establishment of a guide for trimming.
2) The use of an electric hedge trimmer to cut along the string, ensuring a straight line, is caused by the need to maintain uniformity and desired shape in hedge trimming.
3) The repetition of the process with another hedge, including the realignment of the string before trimming, is caused by the intention to achieve consistent and precise results across multiple hedges.
