1) The person in the video turns on the leaf blower, which causes the device to generate a strong airflow.
2) The generated airflow from the leaf blower then causes the fallen leaves to be blown away from the grassy area.
3) As the leaves are being blown away, this action causes the green grass underneath to become visible, revealing patches of clear ground.
4) The continuous use of the leaf blower to blow the leaves into a pile causes a clearer path to be created on the grass, emphasizing the effectiveness of the tool in maintaining outdoor cleanliness.
