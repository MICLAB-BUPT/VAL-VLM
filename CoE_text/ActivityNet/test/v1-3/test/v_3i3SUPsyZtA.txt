1) The video shows a person cooking an omelet in a kitchen.
2) They start by heating oil in a frying pan on the stove, which causes the surface to become hot and suitable for cooking.
3) After the pan is heated, they pour beaten eggs into the pan, causing the eggs to begin to cook upon contact with the hot surface.
4) They use a utensil (either a spatula or a fork) to stir and fold the eggs, which causes the eggs to cook more evenly and form the desired texture of an omelet.
5) The person continues to move or stir the eggs around the pan until they are fully cooked through, indicating that the cooking process is complete.
6) Finally, they slide the cooked omelet onto a plate (described as white in one answer), which presents the finished dish.
