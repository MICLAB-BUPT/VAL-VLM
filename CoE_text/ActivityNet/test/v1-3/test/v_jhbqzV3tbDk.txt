1) The video shows a person welding a metal beam in a workshop environment, which causes the welder to wear protective gear including gloves and a welding helmet for safety.
2) The use of a welding torch by the welder to join two pieces of metal together causes sparks and smoke to be visible as the welding process occurs.
3) The lighting is dim, with the bright light from the welding torch illuminating the area around the weld, which allows the welder to see their work clearly.
4) The welder's movements are precise and controlled, ensuring a strong and secure weld, which leads to the completion of the welding process.
5) After completing the welding process, the welder inspects the welded area, checking for any imperfections or issues that may need to be addressed, which is caused by the desire to ensure the quality and integrity of the weld.
