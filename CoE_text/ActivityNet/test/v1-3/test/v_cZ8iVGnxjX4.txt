1) The woman is seated in a chair at the salon, indicating she is there to get her hair styled.
2) The stylist begins to work on the woman's long, dark hair, which causes the stylist to use a blow dryer and a round brush to style it.
3) The stylist holds the blow dryer in one hand and the brush in the other, carefully working through the woman's hair, which creates volume and shape.
4) The stylist focuses on the lower sections of the woman's hair, ensuring it is smooth and well-styled, causing the upper part of her hair to be partially tied up with a clip.
5) The careful and attentive styling by the stylist results in the woman appearing relaxed and comfortable throughout the process.
