1) The person in a blue shirt begins working on the roof, which causes them to start removing damaged shingles.
2) They use a hammer to pry up the shingles, causing the underlying layer of the roof to be revealed.
3) After prying up each shingle, the individual uses a tool to remove nails and other fasteners from the roof, ensuring that they do not cause further damage to the surrounding area.
4) This careful lifting and removal of each shingle leads to the exposure of the black underlayment and, eventually, the wooden structure underneath as the process is repeated for several more shingles.
5) Once the damaged shingles are removed, the person inspects the exposed area, which prepares them for further repairs.
