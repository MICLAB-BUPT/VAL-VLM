1) A young girl in a pink dress is attempting to hit a large, colorful ice-n-cream cone-shaped piñata at an outdoor carnival or fair, which causes her to swing a bat at the piñata multiple times.
2) She misses each time she swings, causing the piñata, which is suspended from a string, to move slightly with each attempt.
3) The setting of this event, being a park or fairground with trees, a red fence, and various carnival attractions, provides a backdrop that causes other people, including adults and children, to watch the girl's attempts.
4) The presence and actions of the girl cause her family and other park visitors to watch her attempts with amusement.
