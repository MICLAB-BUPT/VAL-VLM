1) The video begins with a cartoon chef holding a banana, which then transitions to a woman in a kitchen preparing an omelette.
2) The woman starts the preparation by grating cheese, causing the cheese to be ready for inclusion in the omelette mixture.
3) She cracks eggs into a bowl, adds salt and pepper, and mixes them thoroughly, leading to a well-combined omelette mixture.
4) Pouring the omelette mixture into a hot pan causes the mixture to begin cooking.
5) Stirring the mixture as it cooks in the pan ensures that the omelette is evenly cooked on one side.
6) Flipping the omelette over to cook on the other side results in the omelette being fully cooked.
7) The finished omelette is placed onto a plate, ready to be served, which completes the omelette preparation process.
