1) The video starts with a black screen displaying the text 'How to insert Contact Lens!' in white font, which then transitions to a woman wearing a red shirt, sitting indoors.
2) The woman begins by holding up a pair of pink contact lens cases and a bottle of multi-purpose solution for contact lenses, causing her to prepare for the demonstration.
3) She demonstrates how to take out a contact lens from its case, showing it to the camera before inserting it into her eye, which leads to her using her right hand to pull down her lower eyelid and her left hand to hold the contact lens near her eye.
4) After inserting the lens, she points to her eyes and shows the difference between her eyes without and with the contact lens, leading her to repeat the process for her other eye, using different hands for each eye.
5) Finally, she holds up the bottle of multi-purpose solution again, indicating that she will use it after inserting both contact lenses, which causes the video to end with her showing off her new look with the contact lenses in place.
