1) The video begins with a woman in a blue top sitting at a vanity table, looking into a mirror, while another woman in a pink top stands behind her, styling her hair.
2) The stylist starts the process by sectioning the seated woman's hair into three equal parts and clipping the side sections, which is done to organize the hair for easier management during the styling process.
3) The stylist then takes a small portion of the back section, clips it first, and straightens it with a flat iron, causing the hair to become smooth and straight.
4) After straightening, the stylist sprays water on the hair, which prepares the hair for the next step and adds moisture, and then uses a round brush and blow dryer to style the hair, resulting in a more polished look.
5) This process of straightening, spraying water, and using the round brush and blow dryer is repeated for all sections until the entire hair is straightened, leading to the completion of the hairstyle.
6) The video ends with the stylist smiling and the woman looking satisfied with her new hairstyle, indicating that the desired outcome has been achieved.
