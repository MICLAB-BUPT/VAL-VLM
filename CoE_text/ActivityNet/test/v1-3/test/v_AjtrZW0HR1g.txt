2) The woman is carrying yoga mats and a green bag, leading her to approach and enter a building with a sign reading 'SOUTH OF BOSTON YOGA'.
3) Entering the building causes the woman to sit on a yoga mat inside, addressing the camera while another person lies on the mat behind her.
4) She starts to demonstrate yoga poses, focusing specifically on abdominal exercises, which results in the man lying on the mat in front of her performing sit-ups as she provides guidance.

6) The split-screen presentation of various videos, including a salad dish and a woman performing leg lifts, eventually causes the video to conclude with the display of social media handles for 'ELEIFITV' at the bottom of the screen.
