1) The video features a man playing the drums on a stage, which causes him to be seated behind a drum set with 'Ludwig' branded bass drums and 'SABIAN' branded cymbals.
2) The man's active use of drumsticks to hit different parts of the drum set creates rhythmic sounds, which is a result of his focused and coordinated movements as he plays the drums with precision.
3) The background setting, including a black curtain, a screen displaying 'SABIAN' and 'I-pro.mark', and a banner reading 'Drummers' Workshop', along with the bright lighting focusing on the drummer and his equipment, enhances the visibility and atmosphere of the performance.
