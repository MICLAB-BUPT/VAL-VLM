1) The video begins with a woman playing the drums in a dimly lit room, wearing a black dress and having long dark hair, which causes the initial focus to be on her.
2) The camera then pans to a man lying on a red couch, who is also wearing a black shirt, causing a shift in the viewer's attention from the woman to the man.
3) The presence of two other people in the room, one lying on a bed and the other standing near the couch, indicates that there are more individuals involved in the scene than initially shown, which adds to the complexity of the setting.
4) The woman, while playing the drums, is also smoking a cigarette, which suggests she is multitasking or feeling relaxed enough to smoke during her performance.
5) The camera focuses back on the woman playing the drums, indicating that despite the presence of others, she remains the central figure of the video, which leads to the conclusion of the video with her still playing.
