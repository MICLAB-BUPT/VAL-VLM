1) A person is applying plaster to a wall using a trowel, causing the wall's rough texture to be smoothed out.
2) The environment appears to be an unfinished room with wooden framing visible, indicating that the action is taking place during construction or renovation work.
3) The individual, who is a man, is wearing casual clothing: specifically, a dark top and light-colored pants, which are described as a black shirt and gray pants.
4) He is focused on the task at hand, moving the trowel in smooth, deliberate motions across the wall's surface, causing the plaster to be evenly spread.
