1) The video begins with a close-up of a bathroom sink area, showcasing various items such as a toothbrush holder with multiple toothbrushes, a bottle of mouthwash, and other toiletries. 
2) A person wearing a white t-shirt (the boy) enters the frame, picks up the mouthwash bottle, and proceeds to open it, causing him to take a swish of the mouthwash.
3) He then pours some mouthwash into his mouth, swishes it around, and spits it out, leading to him standing in front of the mirror, looking at his reflection and smiling.
4) Another individual briefly appears in the frame holding a camera, capturing the moment, which causes the picture to be taken.
5) The person in the white t-shirt (the boy) then exits the bathroom through a door, leaving the room empty, as a result of completing his activity.
