1) The video starts with a close-up of a stainless steel sink, focusing on the drain area.
2) A hand appears and pours baking soda into the drain, followed by vinegar, causing a foaming reaction due to the chemical interaction between the two substances.
3) The mixture is left to sit for a while to allow the reaction to break down any debris or buildup in the drain.
4) Water is poured in, washing away the foam and debris, clearing the drain.
5) A hand uses a brush (or a sponge) to scrub the drain thoroughly, further removing any remaining dirt or grime.
6) After rinsing the sink with water, ensuring all the cleaning agents are washed away, a few drops of essential oil are added to the drain, enhancing the cleaning process and leaving a fresh scent.
7) Finally, the sink is wiped down (or dried) with a cloth (or towel), leaving it clean and shiny.
