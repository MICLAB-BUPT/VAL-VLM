1) The video begins with a title screen that reads 'How To Peel Potatoes' on an orange background, which then transitions to a close-up of peeled potatoes and potato peels on a green surface.
2) This introduction causes the viewer to see a person's hands holding a potato in one hand and a metal peeler in the other, carefully removing the skin from the potato in long strips.
3) After the skin is removed, the peeled potato is placed next to other peeled potatoes on a dark countertop, leading to a pile of peeled potatoes.
4) The presence of a clear plastic container filled with water on the countertop causes the person to place the peeled potatoes into the water-filled container as they continue peeling more potatoes.
5) The process of peeling and placing the potatoes in the water is repeated several times, resulting in multiple peeled potatoes being submerged in the water, ready for further preparation or cooking.
