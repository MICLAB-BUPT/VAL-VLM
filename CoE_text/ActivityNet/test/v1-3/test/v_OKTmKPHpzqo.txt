2) Following this, another skier, Klaus Krolski (AUT), also loses control, leading to him crashing into the netting as well.
3) Subsequently, Tyler Walker (USA) is seen skiing down a slope; however, he eventually falls and tumbles down the hill, indicating that he too lost control.
4) The scene then transitions to a group of people assisting an injured skier on the slope, which is a direct consequence of one of the previous accidents.
5) More skiing accidents involving different skiers are shown, where each skier's loss of control results in crashes into safety nets or falls on the snow, showcasing the intensity and danger of the sport.
6) Lara Gut (SUI) is next seen falling and tumbling down the slope, another instance of a skier losing control and crashing.
7) Finally, M. Höffner-Winter (USA) crashes into the netting, further emphasizing the high-speed nature and risks involved in skiing, with the crashes and tumbles being a result of the skiers' inability to maintain control.
