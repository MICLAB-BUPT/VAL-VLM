2) The scene then cuts to a man in a white chef's coat and black hat, who is initially shown washing dishes in a commercial kitchen using a spray nozzle to rinse them, and placing them in a drying rack, but later is seen cleaning a sink labeled 'WASH' with a sponge and rinsing it under the spray nozzle as well.
3) The presence of several other sinks and a sign that says 'Change gloves often' in the background indicates that the setting is a commercial kitchen focused on maintaining hygiene.
