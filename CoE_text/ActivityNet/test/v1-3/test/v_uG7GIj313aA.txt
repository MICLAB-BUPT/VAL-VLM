1) The video begins with two people measuring and cutting a piece of carpet, which is the initial step to ensure the carpet fits the space.
2) This action causes them to then roll out the carpet on the floor, positioning it correctly.
3) After the carpet is in place, a person uses a tool to secure the carpet along the edges, ensuring it stays in position.
4) Handling a large roll of carpet, possibly preparing it for installation, suggests that there might be more areas or rooms where the carpet needs to be installed, leading to further measuring, cutting, and securing.
5) Throughout the process, individuals use tools like hammers, nail guns, and staple guns to secure the carpet, indicating the need for different methods to attach the carpet firmly to the floor.
6) The careful attention to detail and teamwork cause the successful completion of the carpet installation, as evidenced by the final scene of a person smoothing out the carpet.
