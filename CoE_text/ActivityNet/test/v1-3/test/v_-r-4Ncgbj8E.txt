1) The video shows a man in a black shirt and blue jeans using an electric hedge trimmer to trim the top of a tall, dense hedge.
2) He starts by using a ladder to reach the top of the hedge, which causes him to be able to start trimming from the highest point.
3) The man then uses the hedge trimmer to cut the top of the hedge, causing the beginning of the hedge's reshaping process.
4) After starting from one end, he moves along the length of the hedge, carefully shaping it, which results in the hedge being evenly trimmed.
5) As he moves down the hedge, he continues trimming it, ensuring that the entire hedge is well-maintained.
6) The man appears to be taking his time to do a good job, which leads to a focused and thorough completion of the task.
