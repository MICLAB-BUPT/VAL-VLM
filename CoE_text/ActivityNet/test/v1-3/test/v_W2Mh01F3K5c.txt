1) The video shows a construction worker applying a substance to the walls of a building, which is either plaster or another substance delivered via a hose.
2) The worker, dressed in protective gear including overalls, gloves, and sometimes a mask, uses a tool (either a long-handled tool for plaster or a hose for the other substance) to spread the material evenly across the wall surfaces, causing the walls to be coated uniformly.
3) The action of the worker moving the tool or hose back and forth ensures thorough coverage of the wall, resulting in an even application of the material.
4) The environment where this occurs is an unfinished building or renovation site, with exposed walls and scattered construction materials, indicating that the cause of the worker's actions is part of the ongoing construction or renovation process.
