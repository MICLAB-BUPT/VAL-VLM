1) The woman, dressed in a polka dot apron and a purple shirt, begins the process by holding a box of chocolate cake mix and a yellow spatula, which causes her to open the box and pour its contents into a mixing bowl.
2) She then adds an extra egg, milk instead of water, and a stick of butter instead of oil to the mixing bowl, causing the mixture to be more rich and moist compared to the standard recipe.
3) After thoroughly mixing the ingredients, she pours the batter into cupcake liners placed in a muffin tin or on a baking tray, leading to the preparation for baking.
4) The filled cupcake liners are placed in the oven, and the temperature is adjusted to 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes, causing the cupcakes to bake properly.
5) Once the cupcakes are baked, she fills a piping bag with frosting, which leads to her piping it onto each cupcake, enhancing their appearance and taste.
6) Finally, she finishes off the cupcakes with sprinkles, resulting in a visually appealing and festive presentation, and presents them to the camera.
