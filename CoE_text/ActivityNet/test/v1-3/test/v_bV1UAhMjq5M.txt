1) The video shows a person cleaning a kitchen sink using baking soda and vinegar.
2) They start by pouring baking soda into the sink, which is filled with water, causing the initial setup for the cleaning process.
3) Then, they pour vinegar over the baking soda, causing a foamy reaction due to the chemical interaction between the two substances.
4) The foamy reaction causes the person to use a brush to scrub the inside of the sink, particularly focusing on the drain area, in order to clean it thoroughly.
5) After scrubbing, they rinse the sink thoroughly with water, causing all the cleaning agents and residue to be washed away, completing the cleaning process.
