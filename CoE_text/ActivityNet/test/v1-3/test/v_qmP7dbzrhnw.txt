1) The video shows a woman in a room with white walls and framed pictures, wearing a floral dress and having long brown hair.
2) Initially, the woman is standing and talking, which causes her to then start blow drying her hair using a hair dryer, as her hair appears wet at the beginning.
3) She holds the hair dryer close to her head and moves it around to ensure all sections of her hair are dried, while also using a brush.
4) Throughout the process, she occasionally looks at the camera and adjusts her hair with her hands, ensuring it is properly styled, which leads to her applying a product from a bottle onto her hair after it is dry.
