1) The woman with blonde hair, styled in a bob haircut and wearing a black top, is sitting in front of a wall decorated with various framed pictures and artwork.
2) A stylist with red hair stands behind the blonde woman and begins to work on her hair, which causes the stylist's hands to become visible as she carefully manipulates the hair.
3) The stylist uses a comb to section off strands of the blonde woman's hair, which leads to the creation of a braid.
4) As the stylist braids, she carefully weaves the sections together, ensuring the braid is neatly arranged and extends from the crown of the head down towards the nape of the neck.
5) Throughout the process, the stylist adjusts and secures the braid with pins, which results in a tidy and well-defined final look.
