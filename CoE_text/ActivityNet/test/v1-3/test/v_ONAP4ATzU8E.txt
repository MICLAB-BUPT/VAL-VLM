1) The video starts with a man in a kitchen, talking to the camera. He is wearing glasses and a black t-shirt with white patterns.
2) The man gestures while speaking, then holds up a potato, indicating it will be used in the cooking process, which causes him to demonstrate how to boil potatoes.
3) The scene shifts to a pot of boiling potatoes on a stove, with steam rising from the water, leading to the next step where the man places the boiled potatoes into a bowl of ice water using tongs to cool them down quickly.
4) Cooling the potatoes in ice water causes the skin to loosen, making it easier for the man to peel the potatoes over the bowl, removing the skin easily due to the cold water.
5) The peeled potatoes are shown in the bowl, ready for further preparation, as the man continues to peel each potato individually, ensuring all the skin is removed.
