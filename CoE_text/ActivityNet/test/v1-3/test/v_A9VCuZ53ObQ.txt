1) In a dimly lit hotel room, two individuals are engaged in a playful interaction. The environment is cozy with warm lighting, featuring a bed with white linens and a nightstand with a lamp. A window with curtains suggests it's evening or night outside.
2) One individual, wearing a black hoodie (or jacket) and light-colored pants, lifts the other who is dressed in a white robe (or dress). They seem to be having fun, possibly dancing or playing around.
3) The person in the hoodie (man) attempts to lift the other (woman) off the ground, which causes her to be lifted up by him.
4) He then throws her onto the bed, causing her to fall on it. 
5) The room has a casual, lived-in feel with personal items scattered around, indicating this might be a private moment between friends or family, and in the background, there is a bed, curtains, a window, a lamp, a table, and a suitcase.
