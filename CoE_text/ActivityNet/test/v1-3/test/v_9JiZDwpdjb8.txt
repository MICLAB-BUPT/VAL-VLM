1) The video begins with a group of people on a boat, preparing for a dive, which causes them to be equipped with scuba gear and adjust their equipment before jumping into the water.
2) After they jump into the water, the scene transitions to an underwater view where the divers explore a sunken shipwreck, causing the viewers to see the wreck covered in marine growth, indicating it has been submerged for some time.
3) As the divers swim around the wreck, examining its structure and interacting with each other, it causes them to use hand signals for communication.
4) Bubbles rise from their breathing apparatuses as they navigate through the water, and because the environment is clear, it allows for good visibility of the wreck's details.
5) The clarity of the water and the careful movements of the divers cause them to move slowly and carefully, taking in the sights and sounds of the underwater world.
