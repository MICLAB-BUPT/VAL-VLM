1) The video begins with a close-up of a wooden table where a person's hands are seen dealing playing cards, causing the start of a card-dealing sequence.
2) The person deals multiple cards face up on the table, creating a spread, which includes various suits and numbers, leading to a diverse array of cards being displayed.
3) This process of dealing out new sets of cards and then collecting them again is repeated several times throughout the video, resulting in a cyclical pattern of spreading and gathering the cards.
4) The lighting in the room is dim, casting shadows on the table, which causes it to be difficult to see the details of the cards clearly, affecting the visibility of the specific cards dealt.
