1) The man is in a gym setting, indicating he is there to exercise and improve his physical fitness.
2) He stands on a blue mat with his feet shoulder-width apart, positioning himself for stability and balance during the exercise, which causes him to have a solid base to perform the cable exercise effectively.
3) The man holds a cable machine handle in both hands, which allows him to engage his upper body muscles as he pulls the handle towards his chest, leading to the activation and strengthening of these muscle groups.
4) In another instance, the man kneels on the floor with his knees bent and feet flat, changing his position to target different muscles or to vary the intensity of the workout, causing a shift in the focus of the exercise to primarily target the chest muscles.
5) By extending his arms forward and then pulling them back towards his chest in a controlled motion, he ensures that the chest muscles are being worked out, resulting in a more focused and effective chest exercise.
