1) A woman with long blonde hair, wearing a grey t-shirt, is in a bathroom.
2) She starts by talking to the camera while holding a blue hair dryer and a round brush, which causes her to begin demonstrating how to use these tools on her hair.
3) The demonstration of drying and styling her hair using the hair dryer and brush leads her to apply a product from a bottle onto her hair, explaining its benefits.
4) After applying the product, she uses a spray bottle on her hair, shaking it well before spraying, which results in an even distribution of the product.
5) The application of the spray and the earlier product causes her to continue styling her hair using the hair dryer and brush, ensuring it's smooth and straightened, all while maintaining eye contact with the camera and providing commentary and tips.
