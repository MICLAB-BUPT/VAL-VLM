The provided answers describe two different scenarios involving exercise equipment, and they cannot be logically integrated into a single coherent event as they involve distinct actions with an exercise bike and an elliptical machine. However, if we consider these as separate but similar events, the logical chain for each could be described as follows:

1) A person decides to exercise, which causes them to enter a room where an exercise bike is located.
2) The person starts using the exercise bike, pedaling steadily, which is a direct result of their decision to exercise.
3) After exercising for several seconds, the person's completion of their workout or another personal reason causes them to step off the bike and exit the frame.

For the second scenario:
1) A person decides to exercise, which leads them to approach an elliptical machine.
2) They begin their workout by stepping onto the machine, adjusting their position, and starting to pedal, all of which are steps in fulfilling their intention to exercise.
3) After a period of maintaining a steady pace, the person's decision to finish their exercise session causes them to step off the elliptical and walk away.
