1) The video features a French Bulldog being groomed, and the process is carried out by a person.
2) Initially, the dog is standing on a table, appearing relaxed, which causes the grooming to begin with the trimming of the dog's nails using clippers.
3) After the nails are trimmed, the fur around the paw pads is cut with scissors, leading to the next step where the dog is seen lying down.
4) The person then uses a yellow grooming tool to brush the dog's back, causing the dog to be prepared for its bath.
5) The dog is then bathed in a tub, where water is poured over it from a showerhead, and soap is applied to create lather, which leads to the final step.
6) Finally, the soap is rinsed off under the showerhead, completing the grooming process.
