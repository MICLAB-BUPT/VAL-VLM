1) The woman starts by kneeling on a mat in front of a fireplace, which is the initial position for her exercise routine.
2) From the kneeling position, she transitions into a plank position with her hands on the mat and her body in a straight line, causing her to engage her core and arm muscles for stability.
3) In one version, she extends one leg out to the side while keeping it straight, holding the pose for a few seconds before bringing it back in, and then repeats this with the other leg, causing an increase in the intensity of the workout on her legs and core.
4) In another version, after the plank position, she moves into a side plank, extending one arm out to the side while maintaining a straight body, and alternates sides several times, causing a significant engagement of her oblique muscles and enhancing her overall core strength.
5) Throughout both routines, the woman maintains a steady pace and controlled movements, ensuring that each exercise is performed effectively and safely.
