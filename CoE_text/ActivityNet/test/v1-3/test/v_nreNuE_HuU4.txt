1) The woman sits at a table with various items, including a box of tissues, a white tray with three plastic bags containing different colored substances, and some small objects, which sets the stage for her demonstration.
2) She begins by showing different colored items on the table, such as pink, green, and white objects, to prepare for creating flower-shaped designs, indicating the materials she will use.
3) The woman cuts a piece of paper into a specific shape, causing it to become the base for her flower design.
4) Using a piping bag filled with pink material, she starts to pipe the material in layers onto the cut paper, forming petals and adding details, which results in the creation of a flower.
5) Throughout the process, she explains each step and provides tips, enhancing the instructional value of her demonstration.
6) At one point, she picks up a pink object and examines it closely, possibly to illustrate a particular aspect or characteristic of the material being used, leading to a more detailed understanding of the design process.
7) The video includes close-up shots of the pink flower-shaped object and the woman's face, allowing viewers to better see the intricacies of the design and connect with the demonstrator, thus completing the demonstration.
