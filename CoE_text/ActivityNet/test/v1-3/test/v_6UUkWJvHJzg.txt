1) The video shows a group of people interacting with camels in an outdoor setting, which causes them to be seen standing around the camels, some holding ropes attached to the camels' harnesses.
2) The group then assists two individuals in mounting the camels using a metal platform and ladder, which leads to the man and woman being seen riding on the back of a decorated camel.
3) Once mounted, the camels begin walking along a dirt path, guided by the people on foot, which results in the camel traversing through an open field with sparse vegetation and a few scattered trees.
4) The environment is calm and serene, with no other people or vehicles in sight except for a few parked cars in the background, which suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the overcast sky.
