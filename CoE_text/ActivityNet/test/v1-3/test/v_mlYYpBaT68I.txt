1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'Installing Carpet Trim' and 'By HomeAdditionPlus.com'.
2) It then transitions to a close-up of a carpeted floor where a person, wearing a maroon sweater, uses a tool to remove the old trim, which causes the surface to be prepared for the new trim.
3) The individual kneels on the floor, holding a long wooden strip, which is the new trim, and measures and marks the carpet using a pencil and ruler, ensuring precision.
4) They position the wooden trim along the edge of the carpet, aligning it with the baseboard, which leads to the careful alignment of the new trim.
5) The person presses the new trim into place, making sure it fits snugly against the wall, which prepares it for being secured.
6) Finally, they use a drill to secure the trim in place, ensuring it is firmly attached to the floor, which completes the installation process.
