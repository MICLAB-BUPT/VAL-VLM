1) The woman, wearing a pink top and standing in a bright kitchen, starts the process of making homemade Oreo cookies by explaining the ingredients and steps involved, which includes sugar, cocoa powder, and butter.
2) She mixes these ingredients using a food processor, causing the formation of a dough that is then rolled into balls and placed on parchment paper for baking.
3) The dough balls are baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately 8-9 minutes, leading to the transformation of the raw dough into baked cookies.
4) After baking, the cookies cool down, allowing them to be handled and prepared for the next step.
5) The woman pipes cream cheese frosting onto the cooled cookies, and in some instances, uses green frosting, assembling the cookies into sandwiches, which enhances their taste and appearance.
6) Finally, she showcases the finished product alongside a milkshake, a jar of milk, and holds a glass of milk with a cookie, indicating the completion of the recipe and readiness to enjoy her creation.
