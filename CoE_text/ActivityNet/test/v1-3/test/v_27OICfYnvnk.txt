1) The room is undergoing renovation, which causes the environment to be dusty and the walls to be partially plastered.
2) Two workers in white protective suits and helmets are applying a textured coating to the wall, indicating that they are at an intermediate stage of the renovation process.
3) The worker on the left holds a long-handled tool connected to a hose, spraying the substance onto the wall with precision, causing the material to be applied evenly.
4) The other worker assists by holding a wooden plank against the wall, which is done to guide the application or protect certain areas from the coating, ensuring a controlled and accurate application.
5) Natural light streams through a window, illuminating the scene, which helps the workers to see clearly and apply the coating accurately.
