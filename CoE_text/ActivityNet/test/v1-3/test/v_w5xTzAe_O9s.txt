1) The man in a light blue shirt and dark pants starts by measuring the wall with a tape measure, which causes him to understand the dimensions of the area he needs to cover.
2) After measuring, he uses a red pencil to mark the wall, which allows him to have a guide for where the wallpaper should be placed, ensuring it is straight.
3) He then applies paste to the wallpaper using a brush, causing the wallpaper to become adhesive and ready to stick to the wall.
4) The man carefully aligns the wallpaper on the wall, which ensures that the design matches up correctly and looks seamless.
5) As he presses the wallpaper onto the wall, he smooths it out with his hands and a tool, which removes any air bubbles and causes the wallpaper to adhere smoothly and without wrinkles.
6) For the higher sections, he uses a ladder, enabling him to reach and apply the wallpaper evenly across the entire wall.
7) Finally, after applying the wallpaper, he steps back to inspect his work, which allows him to ensure that the wallpaper is properly aligned and adhered, resulting in a professionally finished look.
