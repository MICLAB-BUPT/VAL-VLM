1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'BUSINESS INSIDER' in white text on a blue background, which causes the transition to a room where people are playing rock-paper-scissors.
2) In this room, both men and women, dressed casually, are seen making hand gestures to represent the game's elements: rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand with fingers extended), and scissors (a hand with the index and middle fingers extended), causing close-ups of their hands showing the game's rules.
3) The scene then shifts to an animated map highlighting 'ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY' and an airplane icon, followed by another title screen reading 'NASH EQUILIBRIUM,' which leads to more scenes of rock-paper-scissors games, emphasizing the 'CONDITIONAL RESPONSE' concept.
4) A title screen appears stating 'HOW PEOPLE PLAY,' leading to the introduction of two animated characters representing 'WINNER' and 'LOSER' roles, which results in animated sequences illustrating the game's dynamics, including scissors cutting paper, paper covering rock, and rock crushing scissors.
5) These animations use simple shapes like arrows and paper icons to visually explain the game mechanics, reinforcing the game's rules and strategies, which culminates in the final scenes depicting a stadium setting with animated hands playing rock-paper-scissors.
