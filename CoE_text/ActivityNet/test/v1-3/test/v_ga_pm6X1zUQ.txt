1) The video shows a man and a woman playing a game where the woman is blindfolded and trying to hit a pinata with a stick.
2) The man is helping her by guiding her towards the pinata, which causes the woman to swing the stick multiple times in an attempt to hit the pinata.
3) However, she misses the pinata each time, causing the man to either continue guiding her until she eventually hits the pinata or take over and hit the pinata successfully.
