1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'Review of Colgate Total Mouthwash' and '#ColgateTotalMW', which causes the viewer to understand the content focus.
2) It then transitions to a woman standing in a bathroom, wearing glasses and a brown patterned top, holding a bottle of Colgate Total mouthwash, which leads to her explaining its features.
3) The woman proceeds to demonstrate the use of the mouthwash by spraying it into her mouth, rinsing, and spitting it out, which is followed by her using a yellow towel to dry her mouth, indicating the completion of the demonstration.
4) Throughout the video, she continues to talk about the product, gesturing with her hands and occasionally looking at the camera, which enhances the engagement and clarity of the explanation.
5) The background remains consistent, showing a typical bathroom setting with a mirror, sink, and various toiletries visible on the counter, including a shower curtain, which provides context and authenticity to the review.
