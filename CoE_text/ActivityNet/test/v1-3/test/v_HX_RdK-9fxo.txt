1) The video begins with the preparation of the subfloor, where a person measures and marks the floor using a tape measure and a pencil, which causes the space to be accurately defined for the installation.
2) The individual then cuts the floor tiles to fit the space using a tile cutter, causing the tiles to be properly sized for the area that needs to be covered.
3) Next, the person applies adhesive to the floor using a notched trowel, ensuring an even spread, which causes the surface to be ready for the placement of the cement board and later the tiles.
4) The man also applies adhesive to the walls and places the cut cement board in place, ensuring it is level and properly aligned, which causes a stable base for the tiles.
5) The person then proceeds to apply adhesive to the tiles before placing them on the cement board, which causes the tiles to adhere firmly to the surface.
6) Throughout the process, the use of a level tool to check the alignment of the tiles ensures they are properly aligned and leveled, which causes the final appearance to be neat and professional.
7) The video concludes with the application of grout between the tiles, which causes the gaps between the tiles to be filled, completing the floor installation.
