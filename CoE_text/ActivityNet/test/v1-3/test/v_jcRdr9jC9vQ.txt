1) The chef, dressed in a white uniform and hat, begins the process of making a chocolate cake in a professional kitchen.
2) The chef starts by pouring a liquid onto the top of a chocolate cake, which causes the base to be moistened and ready for the next layer.
3) He then adds scoops of chocolate ice cream on top, which will serve as a creamy and cold element in the cake.
4) The chef spreads the ice cream evenly with a spatula, ensuring that the layer is smooth and even, which prepares the surface for the next cake layer.
5) Next, he places another layer of chocolate cake on top, causing the cake to gain height and structure.
6) The chef pours more liquid over this new layer, which further enhances the moisture and flavor of the cake.
7) Another scoop of ice cream is added and spread out, adding another rich, creamy layer to the cake.
8) Finally, the chef pours a thick layer of chocolate ganache over the entire cake, which not only adds a luxurious, shiny finish but also seals in the layers, resulting in a visually appealing and delicious dessert.
