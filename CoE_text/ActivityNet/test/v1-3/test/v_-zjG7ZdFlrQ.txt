1) The video showcases a person demonstrating the maintenance of a ski using various tools and products, which causes the individual, wearing a red shirt with a name tag, to be seen working on a ski placed on a workbench.
2) They use a red and yellow waxing iron to apply wax to the ski's surface, ensuring an even coating, which leads to them employing a white cloth to spread the wax evenly across the ski.
3) After spreading the wax, the person uses a small brush to remove excess wax from the ski's base, indicating that they are also using a yellow sponge to apply a substance, likely wax, and spreading it evenly as part of the process.
4) Throughout the process, their interaction with different tools and products laid out on the workbench, including brushes, wax, and other maintenance items, suggests that this activity is taking place in a public or commercial space, as evidenced by the busy indoor setting with people walking by.
