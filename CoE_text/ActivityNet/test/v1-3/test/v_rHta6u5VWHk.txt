1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'MAKEUP WEARABLE' in red and white letters, followed by 'Hair Tutorials' in smaller text.
2) This causes the transition to a woman with long, dark hair styled in a messy side braid adorned with white flowers, setting the stage for the tutorial.
3) The tutorial starts with the woman parting her hair at the top of her head, dividing it into three sections, which allows her to begin braiding the hair.
4) As she braids, adding more strands as she goes along, this process leads to the creation of a half French braid, guided by text overlays providing specific instructions.
5) The incorporation of small sections from the opposite ear to the top strand, and more hair from the bottom strand, ensures the braid remains neat and tight, causing the style to take shape.
6) The braid is then twisted and wrapped around itself to form a bun at the back of her head, transforming the initial braid into a more elaborate hairstyle.
7) Securing the bun with pins and adding white flowers as decorative elements finalizes the look, leading to the woman showcasing the completed messy side braid.
8) The video concludes with a final screen encouraging viewers to subscribe for more tutorials, aiming to engage the audience and promote further content.
