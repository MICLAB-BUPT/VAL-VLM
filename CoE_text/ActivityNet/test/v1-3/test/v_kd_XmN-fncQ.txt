1) The video shows a man in a kitchen preparing breakfast, causing him to first cook bacon on the stove.
2) After starting the bacon, he moves to the counter, where cracking eggs into a bowl and adding cheese occurs, which then leads to mixing these ingredients together.
3) Pouring the mixed ingredients into a frying pan follows, and while the eggs are cooking, he adds more cheese and also cooks some potatoes.
4) Once the eggs are fully cooked, this causes him to transfer them onto a plate, alongside the bacon and potatoes.
5) Finally, adding some chopped herbs as a garnish before presenting the finished breakfast dish completes his preparation.
