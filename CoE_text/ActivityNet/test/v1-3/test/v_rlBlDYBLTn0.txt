1) The video begins with a woman standing in front of a white background, wearing a white top and a gray scarf, and she has long blonde hair styled in a waterfall braid. 
2) The woman then starts to demonstrate how to create the braid by sectioning her hair into three parts and crossing them over each other, which causes the start of the braiding process.
3) She continues to braid her hair, adding more sections as she goes along, causing the braid to form in a cascading manner.
4) The woman uses her hands to manipulate the hair, ensuring that the braid is tight and neat, which leads to a well-structured waterfall braid.
5) After reaching the end of her hair, she secures it with a hair tie, resulting in the completion of the braid.
6) The woman then finishes the braid and holds it up for the camera to see, followed by smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture, indicating her satisfaction with the result.
7) The video ends with the woman showing off her finished waterfall braid, which is the final outcome of the demonstration.
