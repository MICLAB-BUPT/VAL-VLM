1) The video shows a man in a white shirt and shorts working on plastering a ceiling. He is using a trowel to apply plaster to the ceiling, which has several holes and patches. This action is caused by the need to repair and prepare the ceiling surface.
2) After the plaster has dried and the surface is smooth, the same or another man, also in a white shirt and shorts, begins painting the ceiling of the room. He uses a paint roller to apply white paint over the existing gray paint. This step is caused by the completion of the plastering work and the need to give the ceiling a fresh, finished look.
