1) The video begins with a title screen displaying "10 MOST HORRIFIC BULLFIGHTING ACCIDENTS" in bold red and white text against a dark background, which sets the stage for the graphic content that follows.
2) This introduction causes the transition to a series of images showing bullfighting accidents, each accompanied by descriptive text, illustrating the severe injuries or fatalities that occurred.
3) Each image captures moments where individuals, including Mora, Israel Lancho, Jose Tomas, Jimenez, Fernando Cruz, Michael and Lawrence Lehman, an unnamed runner, Julio Aparicio Diaz, and Miguel Ruiz Perez, are in close contact with bulls, often resulting in them being gored, lifted off the ground, or thrown.
4) The depiction of these brutal scenes, such as Mora being flung around like a ragdoll, Israel Lancho's miraculous survival after being impaled, and the graphic nature of the injuries, leads to the final image, which prompts viewers to consider if bullfighting should be banned and invites them to share their thoughts in the comments.
