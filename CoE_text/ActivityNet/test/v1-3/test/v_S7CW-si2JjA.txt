1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the tutorial on filling a sheet cake.
2) It then transitions to a close-up of a chocolate cake being placed on a table, followed by the use of a spatula to level the top, which causes the surface to become smooth and even.
3) The cake is cut in half horizontally using a cake slicer, which allows for the addition of a filling inside.
4) A red filling is piped onto one half of the cake, and the other half is placed on top, creating a layered effect.
5) The person uses a spatula to spread the filling evenly across the top layer, ensuring a consistent distribution.
6) The fully filled and leveled cake is ready for further decoration or frosting, but instead, the video continues showing the person cutting the cake into smaller pieces with a knife, which prepares it for serving.
7) After cutting, the person spreads red icing on the pieces using a spatula, enhancing the flavor and appearance.
8) Finally, the smaller pieces are arranged neatly on a plate, completing the presentation.
