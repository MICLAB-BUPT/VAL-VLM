1) The woman, dressed in a black t-shirt and leggings, begins her workout routine by kneeling on a blue mat in the gym.
2) From the kneeling position, she stands up, which causes her to transition from a lower to a higher body position.
3) After standing, she raises her arms above her head, indicating the start of an exercise movement that likely aims to stretch or prepare for the next action.
4) Raising her arms above her head then leads to her squatting down again, completing a cycle of the exercise, which is aimed at working out specific muscle groups.
5) This sequence of standing up, raising her arms, and then squatting down is repeated, suggesting a series of exercises designed for a full-body workout.
6) Throughout her workout, the presence of various exercise equipment like weight racks and mirrors in the background implies that she is in a well-equipped gym, providing context for her actions.
