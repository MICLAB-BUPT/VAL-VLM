1) The video shows a man and a young boy in a kitchen setting, with the man teaching the boy how to peel potatoes, which causes the atmosphere to be instructional and supportive.
2) The man is holding a potato and a peeler, carefully demonstrating the technique to the boy, which leads to the boy watching attentively and trying to mimic the man's movements.
3) There are carrots on the counter, indicating they might be preparing a meal together, which suggests that after the demonstration, the boy attempts to peel the potato himself under the man's guidance.
