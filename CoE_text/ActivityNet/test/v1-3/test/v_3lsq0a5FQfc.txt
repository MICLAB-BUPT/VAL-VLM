1) The video starts with a woman in a red dress standing in a kitchen, surrounded by various ingredients and utensils.
2) She begins by melting butter in a saucepan on the stove, which causes the butter to become liquid and ready for mixing.
3) Next, she adds cocoa powder to the melted butter and stirs it until smooth, resulting in a chocolate mixture.
4) In parallel, she pours oats into a mixing bowl and adds peanut butter, stirring them together, creating an oat and peanut butter base.
5) She then combines the chocolate mixture with the oat and peanut butter base, causing all the ingredients to be well mixed.
6) Using a spoon (or a metal ice cream scoop as per Answer 2), she scoops portions of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, preparing them for baking.
7) Finally, she places the baking sheet into an oven for baking, which will cause the cookies to bake and solidify.
