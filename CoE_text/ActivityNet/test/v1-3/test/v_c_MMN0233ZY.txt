1) The video shows a group of people working together to plant trees in a park.
2) They are spreading newspapers on the ground, which is likely being used as a weed barrier or to help retain moisture in the soil, causing an environment conducive for the new trees to grow.
3) The people are using shovels and wheelbarrows to move dirt around and create mounds for the tree planting, and some individuals are also digging holes for the trees.
4) After placing the trees into the holes, the group fills the holes around the newly planted trees with soil and mulch carried in wheelbarrows, ensuring the trees are securely planted and have nutrients.
5) Some young boys are also helping with the task, contributing to the collective effort of the group.
