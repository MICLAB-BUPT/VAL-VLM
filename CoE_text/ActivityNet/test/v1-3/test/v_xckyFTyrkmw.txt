1) The video starts with a child in a kitchen setting, wearing a green camouflage shirt.
2) The child is seen preparing ingredients on a table, including oats and various containers of ingredients like peanut butter and chocolate, which indicates the preparation for making a recipe.
3) The child then moves to the stove where they pour water into a pot and stir it with a wooden spoon, causing the ingredients to begin mixing.
4) Next, the child adds peanut butter to the pot and stirs it until it melts, which leads to the creation of a smooth, combined mixture.
5) The melted mixture is then poured over the oats in a bowl, and the child mixes the oats and peanut butter together, forming a dough-like consistency, which prepares the base for the cookies.
6) They then place the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and press it down to flatten it, shaping the cookies for baking.
7) Afterward, the child places the baking sheet into an oven, which causes the cookies to bake and solidify.
8) In another scenario, instead of placing the baking sheet into an oven, the girl puts the mixture in the refrigerator to set, resulting in a no-bake version of the recipe.
9) Finally, in the first scenario, the child takes out the baked oatmeal cookies from the oven and shows them to the camera, concluding the baking process.
