1) The woman, dressed in a striped shirt and black pants (or black leggings and pink sneakers), sits on the rowing machine, which causes her to be in the correct position for demonstrating the rowing technique.
2) She secures her feet under the footrests and holds the handlebar with both hands, causing her to have the necessary grip and stability for performing the rowing motions.
3) The woman then begins to perform a series of smooth and controlled rowing motions, pulling the handlebar towards her body while extending her legs, which demonstrates the proper form and technique for using the rowing machine.
4) As she continues, maintaining a steady rhythm, this emphasizes the importance of consistency and control in executing the rowing exercise effectively.
5) In the background, another person attentively observes the demonstration, which suggests that the observer is learning from the woman's example, thus reinforcing the educational aspect of the video.
