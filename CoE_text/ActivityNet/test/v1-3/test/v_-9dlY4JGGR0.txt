1) The man in a yellow shirt and red cap starts by wheeling an orange wheelbarrow filled with soil towards the tree, causing him to prepare for landscaping work.
2) He places the wheelbarrow down near the tree, which allows him to begin shoveling soil from the wheelbarrow onto the ground around the tree.
3) As he repeatedly lifts the shovel, scoops soil, and places it on the ground, this action gradually builds up the soil around the base of the tree.
4) To ensure the soil is evenly distributed, he moves back and forth between the wheelbarrow and the tree, leading to a more uniform spread of soil.
5) After creating a small mound around the tree trunk, he uses a rake to spread the soil evenly around the tree, resulting in a neatly raked area.
6) Finally, he lifts the now empty wheelbarrow and walks away from the tree, leaving behind a well-maintained and landscaped area.
