1) A man in a yellow shirt and blue jeans is seen in a room with wallpapered walls, indicating that the room has been previously decorated.
2) The man is engaged in the process of removing wallpaper from the wall, which is caused by the need to either redecorate or renovate the space.
3) He uses a tool to scrape off the wallpaper, starting from the top corner of the wall, methodically working his way down. This action is taken to ensure that all the wallpaper is removed smoothly without damaging the underlying surface.
4) After the old wallpaper, which has a pattern of pink and white stripes, is completely removed, the man then begins to apply new wallpaper to an angled wall.
5) Using a brush, he smooths out the new wallpaper, ensuring it adheres properly to the surface. This step is necessary for achieving a neat and professional finish.
6) The man works diligently, kneeling down at times to reach lower areas of the wall, showing his commitment to thoroughness.
7) He also uses a tool to cut the wallpaper to size, which is required for a precise fit on the wall, especially in a room with a slanted ceiling, suggesting it might be an attic or a sloped-roof area.
8) The video captures his methodical approach to both the removal and application processes, highlighting the attention to detail required for this task.
