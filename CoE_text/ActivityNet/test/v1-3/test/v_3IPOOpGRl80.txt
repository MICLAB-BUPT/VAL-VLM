1) The video begins with a group of children in colorful costumes, including a yellow one with a blue square on the chest, gathered together.
2) The scene then transitions to an outdoor, urban setting where two of these children are seen walking towards a woman carrying bags, which causes her to help them put on rollerblades.
3) After getting their rollerblades on, the children, now also wearing protective gear such as helmets and knee pads, start skating around on a paved surface.
4) During their skating, one child falls down but gets back up, and they continue skating, with some performing jumps and tricks.
5) The activity of rollerblading and the subsequent fall and recovery cause the children to eventually stop and sit at a table, eating ice cream cones, which marks the end of the video.
