1) A man wearing a hat and black shorts approaches a red riding lawn mower in a large, grassy yard with some trees and bushes in the background.
2) The man sits on the mower, starts it, and begins mowing the lawn in straight lines, which causes the grass to be cut shorter.
3) He continues to mow the lawn, making several passes across the yard by moving back and forth, which results in neatly cut grass.
4) After completing his work, the man drives away on the lawn mower, which signifies the end of the lawn mowing activity.
