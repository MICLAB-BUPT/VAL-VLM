1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the tutorial on making a round thick board.
2) A person's hands are seen using a red utility knife to cut a piece of white material, likely foam or cardboard, on a cutting mat.
3) The individual measures and marks the material with a pencil and ruler, ensuring precision.
4) They then trace around a circular object to create a template for the board's shape, which causes the precise outline needed for the next steps.
5) Next, the person applies hot glue along the traced lines, which allows them to carefully wrap aluminum foil around the glued edges.
6) Smoothing out the aluminum foil ensures a clean finish, completing the process that involves multiple steps of measuring, marking, tracing, and wrapping, demonstrating a methodical approach to crafting the board.
