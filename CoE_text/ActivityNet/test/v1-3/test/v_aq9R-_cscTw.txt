1) The video begins with a close-up of an old wooden dresser in a garage, showing its worn-out state, which causes the need for refinishing.
2) A person is seen sanding the dresser's surface to prepare it for refinishing, causing the removal of the old, worn-out finish and creating a smooth base for new paint.
3) Next, the person applies a white primer over the entire dresser using a brush, ensuring even coverage, which causes the surface to be ready for painting by sealing and protecting the wood.
4) Following this, the dresser is painted with a light blue color, giving it a fresh and updated look, caused by the application of the new paint.
5) The person then sands down the edges of the dresser drawers to distress them, creating a vintage appearance, caused by the intentional wear on the newly painted surface.
6) Finally, the dresser is finished with a clear topcoat to protect the paint and enhance its shine, caused by the desire to safeguard the refurbished dresser and give it a polished appearance.
