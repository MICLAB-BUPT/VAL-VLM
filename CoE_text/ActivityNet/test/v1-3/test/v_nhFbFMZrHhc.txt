1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'Back to the Cut the Grass' in green text on a black background, which then transitions to a sunny outdoor setting.
2) In this setting, a person, wearing a white shirt, blue shorts, and a hat, is seen mowing a lawn with a red lawnmower, causing the grass to be cut as he moves back and forth across the lawn.
3) The man starts by pushing the lawnmower across the grassy area in front of a house, then moves to another part of the yard, continuing to mow the grass, which results in various angles being captured by the camera, including close-ups of the lawnmower and wide shots of him working.
4) Occasionally, the person stops to adjust the lawnmower or take a break, leading to a scene where he walks towards a clothesline with laundry hanging on it, indicating a pause from his mowing activity.
5) The video concludes with a black screen displaying '26-05-2012' and 'MISHKA' in green text, followed by 'Give You All The Love', marking the end of the event.
