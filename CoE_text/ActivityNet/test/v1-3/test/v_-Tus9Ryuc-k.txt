1) The video begins with the person melting butter in a saucepan, which causes the butter to become liquid and ready for the next ingredient.
2) Adding dark chocolate pieces to the melted butter and stirring until smooth creates a smooth chocolate mixture, which is essential for the base of the chocolate balls.
3) Cracking eggs into a bowl and beating them with sugar until frothy prepares the egg mixture, which when combined with the chocolate, will cause the formation of a richer, more complex flavor and texture.
4) Pouring the melted chocolate into the beaten egg and sugar mixture and blending until smooth integrates the ingredients, causing a homogenous blend that will contribute to the overall consistency of the final product.
5) Sifting dry ingredients like cocoa powder, baking powder, and flour into the mixture and then stirring to combine ensures there are no lumps, which causes the batter to have an even distribution of flavors and leavening agents.
6) Covering and refrigerating the mixture for about 1 hour or until it becomes firm allows the batter to set, making it easier to handle and shape into balls.
7) Scooping the chilled mixture into balls and rolling them in powdered sugar prepares the chocolate balls for baking, giving them a sweet outer coating.
8) Placing the sugar-coated balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and baking in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 15 minutes causes the chocolate balls to cook, resulting in a delicious, baked treat ready to be served.
