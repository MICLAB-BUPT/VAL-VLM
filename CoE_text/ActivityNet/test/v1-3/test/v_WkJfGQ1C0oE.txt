2) A woman in a red top and black pants is blindfolded and being guided by another person in a striped shirt to hit the piñata.
3) The woman takes several swings at the piñata, but it remains intact, causing another person, also wearing a striped shirt, to take a turn.
4) The surroundings are dimly lit with only the light from the streetlights illuminating the area, which causes the ground to be littered with pieces of the broken piñata as they continue their attempts.
5) The individuals show determination and excitement throughout the video, continuing to swing at the piñata.
