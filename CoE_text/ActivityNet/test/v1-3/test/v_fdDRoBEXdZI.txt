1) The woman starts by brushing her hair, which causes it to become smooth and free of tangles.
2) She then sections her hair into four parts using clear hair elastic bands, which allows for organized and manageable braiding.
3) Braiding each section tightly and neatly causes the creation of a structured base for the updo.
4) Twisting the completed braids upwards and securing them at the top of her head with pins results in a crown-like structure, forming the main body of the hairstyle.
5) Using a curling iron to add soft curls to the ends of her hair enhances the overall elegance and texture of the updo, completing the look.
