1) The video begins with a woman standing in front of a door, wearing a black t-shirt and jeans, holding a roll of wallpaper and a measuring tape, which causes the scene to transition to a close-up of various tools and materials needed for wallpapering.
2) The display of the necessary tools and materials, including a plastic drop cloth, a level, a pencil, a sponge, a water tray, liquid soap, a towel, and two razors, leads to the woman demonstrating how to use these tools by measuring the wall, marking the wallpaper, and cutting it to size.
3) After preparing and cutting the wallpaper, the woman then proceeds to show how to apply the wallpaper to the wall using a brush and a roller, which involves applying adhesive, carefully placing the wallpaper onto the wall, ensuring it is straight, and smoothing it out with a squeegee to be free of air bubbles.
4) The successful application and smoothing of the wallpaper result in the woman smiling at the camera, indicating that she has successfully completed the wallpapering task.
