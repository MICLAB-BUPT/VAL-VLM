1) The video begins with a title screen introducing 'Rob Gardner Professional Decorators' and the specific task of hanging a finished wallpaper.
2) A man in a light blue shirt and white pants is seen preparing the wall, which causes him to measure and mark the wall using a red measuring tape.
3) After marking, he smooths out the wall, causing it to be ready for the application of the wallpaper.
4) The man then rolls out the wallpaper on a table, which leads to him cutting it to size.
5) He applies adhesive to the wall using a yellow sponge, which results in the wall being ready for the wallpaper to adhere.
6) The man carefully aligns and pastes the wallpaper, ensuring it adheres smoothly without air bubbles or wrinkles, which causes the wallpaper to be positioned correctly.
7) He uses a brush to smooth out the wallpaper from top to bottom, making final adjustments, which ensures a professional finish.
8) The man repeats this process for multiple sections of the wall, making sure each piece is aligned correctly, which results in the entire wall being evenly covered.
