1) The video shows a young boy in a bathroom wearing a dark blue robe.
2) He is seen talking and gesturing with his hands, possibly explaining something or giving instructions, which causes the viewer to understand that he is demonstrating a specific process or routine.
3) The boy then pours a blue liquid from a bottle into a small white cup, which he holds up to the camera, indicating the significance of the liquid.
4) He proceeds to drink the contents of the cup, tilting his head back as he does so, which leads to the next step where after drinking, he leans over the sink.
5) He rinses his mouth with the liquid and spits it out into the sink, suggesting that the purpose of the blue liquid is for oral hygiene.
