5) The background, consisting of brown tiles, sets the scene but does not directly influence the solving of the cube.
6) The person's continuous and quick hand movements cause the cube to transition from a scrambled state to a fully solved one.
7) The completion of the cube's solution, resulting in all six sides being aligned, leads to the final display of the solved cube.
8) The timer showing 42.46 seconds marks the end of the event, representing the total duration it took for the person to solve the Rubik's Cube.
