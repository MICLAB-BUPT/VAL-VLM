2) The scene transitions to a person preparing a cake for decoration on a wooden table, indicating the start of the demonstration.
3) The preparatory actions, such as smoothing out a piece of black fondant over a white surface and placing a brown fondant piece on top of the black one, are taken to create a base for the cake decoration, ensuring a flat and even foundation.
4) Using a rolling pin to flatten the black fondant further and then cutting and placing a piece of white fondant on top, smoothed out to cover the entire surface, serves to add layers and contrast to the cake's design, enhancing its visual appeal.
5) Measuring and cutting the white fondant into a specific shape using a ruler ensures precision in the decoration, contributing to the overall neatness and professionalism of the final product.
