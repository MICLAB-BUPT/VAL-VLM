1) The video begins with a person in a gray jacket and black pants pushing another person, who is wearing a white hat and dark clothing, on an orange snow tube down a snowy hill.
2) As the person in the gray jacket releases the tube, it causes the tube to continue sliding down the hill, gaining speed as it goes.
3) The person who pushed the tube then walks away from the camera, watching the person on the tube, while the camera follows the tube as it travels down the slope, passing by red safety netting and other skiers and snowboarders scattered across the hill.
