1) The video shows a young boy in a white shirt and dark pants standing in front of a couch, holding another person, who appears to be a child, on his shoulders.
2) This causes the boy to lift the child up and spin around with him on his shoulders.
3) After spinning around, the action leads to the boy putting the child down on the couch.
4) In another instance, the boy, still wearing a white t-shirt, is observed holding another boy in his arms, which then results in him lifting and throwing this second boy onto the sofa.
5) The scene takes place in a living room, where the presence of a couch, a lamp, some flowers, a wall, and a window in the background sets the environment for these actions.
