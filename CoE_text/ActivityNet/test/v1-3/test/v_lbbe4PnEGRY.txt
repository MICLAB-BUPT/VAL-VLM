1) The man unloads materials from a van, including roofing supplies and tools, which is the preparation for the installation of a new flat roof.
2) He begins by removing old roofing material, causing the surface to be clear for the new installation.
3) The man then lays down insulation boards, which cause the roof to have better thermal performance.
4) Following that, he installs a black waterproofing layer on the ground, which causes the roof to be protected against water damage.
5) Spreading gravel over the waterproofing layer causes additional protection and stability.
6) Next, installing wooden planks as the base for the roof, and using a nail gun to secure them in place, causes a solid foundation for the rest of the materials.
7) Cutting and fitting a metal strip along the edge of the roof, after applying adhesive, causes the edges to be sealed and secured.
8) Rolling out a white sheet onto the wooden base, ensuring it is properly aligned and secured, causes the roof to gain another layer of waterproofing.
9) Continuing to roll out more sheets, covering the entire surface of the roof, causes the whole area to be uniformly protected.
10) Applying a brown coating over the entire roof, smoothing it out evenly, causes the final protective and aesthetic finish.
11) Using a drill and a roller to ensure proper alignment and adhesion of all components, alongside applying sealant around the edges, causes the roof to be watertight and well-constructed.
