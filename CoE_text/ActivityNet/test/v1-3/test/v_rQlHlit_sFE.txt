1) The video starts with a black screen displaying the text 'mynewbody.com.au' in green and white, which causes it to transition to a title card that reads 'AB CRUNCHES' in white letters on a black background, with the same logo at the top left corner.
2) This then leads to a scene shift to an outdoor setting where a woman is lying on her back on a grassy field, performing abdominal crunches, with her knees bent, feet flat on the ground, and hands clasped behind her head.
3) She repeatedly lifts her upper body towards her knees while keeping her lower back on the ground, causing close-up shots to highlight her abdominal muscles as she continues to perform the crunches.
4) The background shows a scenic view of the ocean and some bushes, which contributes to the overall visual appeal of the video.
5) The video concludes by transitioning back to another black screen displaying the text 'For more free fitness, weightloss & nutrition resources & videos, check out mynewbody.com.au' in white letters, along with the green logo, as a result of the exercise demonstration coming to an end.
