1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'FLUORBLOCK WAXING BY RUBBING' and 'ski wax vahti', setting the context for the demonstration.
2) It transitions to a black background with red text, which outlines the steps: rubbing a layer of block on glide zones and fixing with natural cork, providing instructions for the viewer.
3) The scene then shifts to a person wearing a blue apron labeled 'Nordica' working on a ski placed on a workbench, indicating the start of the practical demonstration.
4) They use a block to rub wax onto the ski's base, moving it back and forth, which is the first step in applying the wax as per the outlined instructions.
5) Next, they switch to using a heat gun, applying heat to the ski while continuing to rub the wax, which helps in melting and spreading the wax more evenly, enhancing its application.
6) The person also uses a waxing iron, moving it back and forth along the length of the ski, to further ensure that the wax is properly melted and distributed across the surface, contributing to an even coating.
7) Additionally, they use a brush to spread the wax evenly across the surface, ensuring a smooth and consistent layer, which is crucial for the performance of the ski.
8) The video concludes with a black screen displaying 'COOL DOWN FEW MINS' and 'FINISHING WITH NYLONBRUSH', indicating the final steps required after the wax has been applied, allowing the wax to set and finishing the process.
