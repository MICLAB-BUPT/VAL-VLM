1) The video begins with a close-up of a pumpkin on a blue surface, followed by a calico cat sniffing it.
2) A hand then places a white pumpkin next to the orange one, and the scene transitions to a paper with various pumpkin face designs labeled 'EYES,' 'NOSE,' and 'MOUTH.'
3) A hand points at different designs, selecting a specific face, which causes the chosen design to be drawn onto an orange pumpkin.
4) The person starts carving the pumpkin by cutting the top and removing the stem, which allows them to scoop out the seeds and pulp from inside.
5) After cleaning the inside, they use a knife to carefully cut out the design, creating the eyes, nose, and mouth of the jack-o'-lantern, following the previously drawn design.
6) The carved pumpkin is shown glowing from within, indicating it has been lit from inside, as a result of the completed carving process.
7) The video concludes with two women in Halloween-themed makeup, one adjusting her hair while the other looks on, against a backdrop featuring musical instruments and a guitar.
