1) The video opens with a man in a sports jersey standing on a grassy field, speaking to the camera. He is wearing a white and blue jersey with the number 4 and the name 'de Vries' on it. The background shows parked cars and a building.
2) The man gestures with his hands while talking, and at one point, he points towards the camera, which causes the scene to transition to a hurling match where players in red and black jerseys are seen running and playing with a ball on the field.
3) After showing the players using hurleys to hit a small ball and running around the field trying to score goals, the focus then shifts back to the man in the sports jersey, who continues to speak to the camera.
4) The scene changes again to another man in a gray t-shirt with a graphic design, standing on the same grassy field and speaking to the camera, causing the video to also include shots of other individuals such as a woman in a gray t-shirt and a man in a red shirt, who are also speaking to the camera.
5) The overall tone of the video is casual and relaxed, with a focus on promoting hurling and encouraging viewers to try the sport, leading to the final scene where the video ends with two people standing together on the grassy field, one wearing a black jacket and the other in a black jacket with a blue scarf, both smiling and looking at the camera.
