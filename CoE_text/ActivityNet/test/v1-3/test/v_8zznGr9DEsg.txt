1) A man wearing a black and red t-shirt, black shorts, and gray shoes is in a gym.
2) The man kneels on the floor with his knees bent and feet flat on the ground, which causes him to be in a stable position for the exercise.
3) He holds a cable machine handle with both hands, causing him to engage with the equipment necessary for the cable row exercise.
4) He starts pulling the cable towards his chest while keeping his back straight, which causes the activation of his back muscles.
5) At the top of the movement, he squeezes his shoulder blades together, which further engages his back muscles and enhances the effectiveness of the exercise.
6) After reaching the top of the movement, he slowly releases the cable back to the starting position, which causes a controlled return that helps in maintaining muscle tension and preventing injury.
