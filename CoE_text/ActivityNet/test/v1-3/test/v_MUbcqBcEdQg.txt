1) The man, wearing a blue welding helmet and casual clothing, approaches the old, rusty engine in an outdoor setting, which is part of a larger machine or vehicle.
2) He inspects the engine, identifying the need for repair or modification, causing him to prepare his tools, including a hammer and a welding torch.
3) The man then starts working on the engine, using a welding tool to weld a metal piece placed on a makeshift workbench, which creates sparks as he secures the metal piece.
4) After completing the welding, he steps back from the workbench, leaving the welded metal piece in place, indicating that this phase of his repair or modification work is finished.
