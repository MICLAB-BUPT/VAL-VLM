1) The video features a woman in a gym setting, wearing black athletic attire and sneakers.
2) She is demonstrating various abdominal exercises on a black mat, with the environment including gym equipment like weight machines and benches.
3) The woman starts by lying flat on her back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, which causes her to transition to lifting her legs off the ground while keeping them straight.
4) This action leads her to perform leg raises, alternating between raising both legs simultaneously and individually, emphasizing proper form.
5) Additionally, she demonstrates controlled movements while engaging her core muscles, which then results in her performing leg lifts with her knees bent at a 90-degree angle, maintaining a steady rhythm throughout the exercise routine.
