1) The video starts with a close-up of a pumpkin, which has a bunny face design drawn on it and is illuminated from within.
2) The person then cuts off the top and bottom of the pumpkin, causing the interior to be exposed for scooping out.
3) After the insides are removed, the hands draw a detailed bunny face design on the pumpkin's surface, leading to the next step where the design is carved out, including the eyes, nose, and mouth.
4) Once the carving is completed, lemon juice is added inside the pumpkin, likely to preserve it or prevent browning.
5) Finally, the carved pumpkin is placed inside a bunny costume, and a candle is lit inside, resulting in a glowing bunny-themed lantern.
