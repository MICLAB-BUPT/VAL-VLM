1) A young girl in a pink dress starts the process of making a cake, which causes her to gather and mix the necessary ingredients.
2) She begins by pouring flour into a measuring cup, then adds sugar and cocoa powder to a mixing bowl, causing the base of the cake mixture to form.
3) The addition of an egg and oil to the bowl, followed by stirring, causes the ingredients to blend, creating the cake batter.
4) Pouring the batter into a white plate and placing it in the microwave for 3 minutes causes the cake to cook.
5) After the cooking is complete, removing the cake from the microwave and letting it cool on a plate causes the cake to reach a suitable temperature for eating.
6) Finally, sitting at a table with a spoon and enjoying eating the cake is caused by the completion of the cake-making process.
