1) A man in a white tank top and blue shorts is painting a wooden fence with a spray gun, which causes the fence to have a mix of unpainted and painted sections.
2) The man methodically moves the sprayer back and forth, ensuring even coverage, which results in the fence being partially painted brown.
3) The garden behind him has green plants and a clothesline with blue hangers, and it's a sunny day with clear skies, which provides a pleasant environment for the man to work in.
