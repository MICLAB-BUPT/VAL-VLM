1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'Chamonix - Brevet-Fleérique 2013' against a black background, which causes the viewer to anticipate the content about to be shown.
2) It transitions to a snowy mountain landscape where people are gathered under tents and umbrellas, preparing for skiing, which leads to the scene of a ski lift ascending the mountain, showing skiers and snowboarders enjoying the slopes.
3) A car drives on a road surrounded by snow-covered mountains, followed by a group of skiers at the bottom of a slope, which then results in the video capturing various perspectives of skiing down the slopes, including first-person views and wide shots of the mountainous terrain.
4) Skiers navigate through snowy paths, with some scenes showing them in colorful winter gear, which allows the video to showcase a group of people skiing and snowboarding down a snowy mountain slope, wearing winter gear, including helmets and goggles, as they navigate the slopes with skill and precision.
5) The skiers and snowboarders are captured in various positions, some gliding smoothly while others make sharp turns, demonstrating their expertise in winter sports, which ultimately leads to the video concluding with a final title screen crediting 'Made by Christian Dagen-Hansen © 2013'.
