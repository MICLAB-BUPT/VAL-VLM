1) The bright and sunny environment with clear skies causes the two children to decide to play on the sandy beach.
2) The decision to play on the beach leads to the children starting to build a sandcastle, using their hands to shape and mold the sand.
3) The children's focus and careful, deliberate movements cause the creation of a structure that resembles a castle, indicating their cooperation and engagement in the activity.
4) One child wearing blue shorts kneels down while the other in black shorts stands up, which allows them to work from different angles and contribute to the construction of the sandcastle in various ways.
5) The presence of a small tower and a moat in the sandcastle is caused by the boys' creativity and collaboration as they use their hands to form these features.
