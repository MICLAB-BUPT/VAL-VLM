1) A person is standing in a bathroom, holding a bottle of mouthwash.
2) They unscrew the cap and tilt their head back to pour the liquid into their mouth, causing the mouthwash to enter their mouth.
3) The man then proceeds to gargle the mouthwash thoroughly, ensuring it reaches all areas of his mouth, which is done to clean and freshen his oral cavity.
4) After a few seconds, he spits out the mouthwash into the sink, completing the act of using the mouthwash.
