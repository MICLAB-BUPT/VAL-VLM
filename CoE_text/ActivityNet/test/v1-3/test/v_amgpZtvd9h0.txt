2) The hands of an unseen person are seen weaving strands of hair together to form the braid, causing the transformation of the girl's hair from loose strands to a structured braid.
3) Subsequently, the braid is secured with pins, ensuring it stays in place, which leads to the addition of decorative elements like a bow and a hair clip to complete the hairstyle.
