1) The video features two men on an ice rink, one dressed in a black and red jacket with a cap, and the other in a red hockey jersey.
2) They are engaged in a conversation about hockey techniques, with the man in the black and red jacket demonstrating various moves using his hockey stick, which causes the man in the red jersey to listen attentively and occasionally respond.
3) At one point, they both bend down to pick up a puck from the ice, which leads to the man in the red jersey demonstrating a hockey move by tapping the puck with his stick.
4) A third person in a red hockey uniform joins them, and they all practice together, focusing on puck handling skills, which further emphasizes the instructional nature of their gathering.
5) The background shows advertisements for 'SUN SUN' and 'CRIMINE STOPPERS,' along with contact information, but this does not affect the main action.
6) The video concludes with both men discussing the techniques demonstrated earlier, emphasizing the importance of proper form and technique in hockey, which is a continuation of the educational purpose of their meeting.
