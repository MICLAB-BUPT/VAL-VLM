1) The video showcases a person cleaning a stainless steel sink using a product called 'SURGE Industrial Hard Surface Cleaner'.
2) Initially, the sink appears dirty with visible stains and grime, which causes the person to spray the cleaner directly onto the sink's surface.
3) The cleaner creates foam as it hits the stains, which allows the green sponge to be used to scrub the sink thoroughly, focusing on the stained areas.
4) After scrubbing, water is run over the sink to rinse off the foam and cleaner, which removes the remaining dirt and residue.
5) Finally, a white cloth is used to wipe down the sink, revealing a clean and shiny surface underneath, which concludes the cleaning process.
