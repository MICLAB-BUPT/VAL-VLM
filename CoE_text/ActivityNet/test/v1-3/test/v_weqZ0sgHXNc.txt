1) The video begins with a black screen, which transitions to a title card, indicating the start of the production by "Butter on Toast Productions".
2) This is followed by a quote from Ernest Hemingway, setting a tone or theme for the video, possibly related to the perceived courage or lack thereof in the bullfighting scenes.
3) The scene then shifts to a bullfighting arena, where the matadors, who are dressed in traditional attire and use capes to guide the bulls, engage with the powerful and aggressive bulls. This transition causes the viewer to be immersed in the intense and dramatic interactions between the matadors and the bulls.
4) As the video progresses, it shows multiple instances of bulls attacking people (presumably matadors), leading to some of them being knocked down and injured, as evidenced by close-ups of faces covered in blood. The repeated depiction of such attacks emphasizes the danger and violence inherent in the sport.
5) The video alternates between showing different bullfighting events, each time with the bull charging at and attacking the person, whether they are dressed in pink, white, or blue, causing them to fall and get hurt. This repetition underscores the persistent risk faced by the participants in the bullfights.
