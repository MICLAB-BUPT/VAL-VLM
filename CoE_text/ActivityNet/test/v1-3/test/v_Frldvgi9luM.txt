1) A person (a girl) wearing a blue t-shirt and grey pants is standing on top of an air conditioning unit in a backyard.
2) The person (girl) is holding onto a rope swing attached to a tree branch, which causes her to start swinging back and forth.
3) As the person (girl) swings, she gains momentum with each swing, but this also causes her to lose balance while swinging forward.
4) The loss of balance causes the person (girl) to fall off the swing.
5) After falling, the person (girl) lands on the grassy ground next to the air conditioning unit.
