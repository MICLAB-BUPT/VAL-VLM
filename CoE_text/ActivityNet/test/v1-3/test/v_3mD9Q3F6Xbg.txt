1) The setting of a well-lit indoor fencing training room causes the fencers to have clear visibility, enabling them to engage in a match with precision and agility.
2) The fencers being dressed in white fencing uniforms, including protective masks and gloves, causes them to be properly equipped for safety and mobility during the match.
3) The use of épées by the fencers causes them to perform both offensive and defensive movements, such as advancing, retreating, lunging, and parrying, which are essential techniques in fencing.
4) The marked fencing piste with a white line down the middle causes the fencers to stay within the designated area, ensuring fair play and adherence to the rules of the sport.
5) The presence of circular targets of varying sizes and colors on the wall behind the fencers suggests that these are used for scoring or practice purposes, which contributes to the overall skill development and performance of the fencers.
