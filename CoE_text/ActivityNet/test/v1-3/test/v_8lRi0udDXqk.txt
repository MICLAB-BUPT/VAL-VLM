1) The video showcases a man in a workshop setting, working on a pair of skis.
2) He is seen scraping the base of the skis with a green tool, likely to remove old wax or debris, which causes the surface to become free of unwanted material.
3) After scraping, the man uses a brush to clean the skis thoroughly, ensuring they are free of any remaining material, which leads to a clean surface ready for new wax.
4) Following the cleaning, he applies new wax to the skis using a waxing iron, carefully spreading it across the surface, which results in an even and protective layer.
5) Finally, he uses a cloth to buff the skis, giving them a smooth and polished finish, which enhances their performance and appearance.
