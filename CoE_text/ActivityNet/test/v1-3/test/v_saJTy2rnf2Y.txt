1) The man in the workshop, wearing a plaid shirt and a cap, starts by applying white paint to the top of the wooden chest using a brush, ensuring even coverage. 
2) After painting the top, he shows the difference between the painted and unpainted sections, highlighting the transformation, which causes him to emphasize the importance of painting the edges.
3) This emphasis on thoroughness then leads him to continue applying the paint, focusing on the edges and corners for complete coverage.
4) As he continues, he explains his technique, which causes him to occasionally pause to inspect his work, ensuring that the paint is evenly distributed and that there are no missed spots.
5) He then moves on to the sides and bottom of the chest, carefully painting each section, which results in a fully transformed piece with a consistent, even coat of white paint.
