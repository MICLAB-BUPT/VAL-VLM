1) A blindfolded woman is attempting to hit a piñata at an outdoor event, likely a birthday party, causing her to rely on the guidance of another person.
2) The woman's need for direction causes the man standing behind her to guide her by placing his hand on her back.
3) As she swings the stick multiple times, trying to hit the piñata, it leads to scattered pieces of the piñata on the blue tarp covering the ground.
4) The activity of the woman hitting the piñata and the presence of the guiding man causes other people in the background, including children playing and adults watching, to observe the scene.
