1) The video showcases a hair salon environment where a woman is getting her hair styled, initially seated in a salon chair with a black cape draped over her shoulders.
2) A stylist, wearing a brown jacket and rings on her fingers, begins the process by discussing the styling with the woman, which causes the stylist to start braiding the woman's hair into neat cornrows.
3) The stylist uses a comb to part the hair and secure it with pins, ensuring each braid is tight and even, which leads to the application of long, thick extensions of hair to the woman's head.
4) To blend the extensions seamlessly with the natural hair, the stylist trims the ends of the extensions with scissors for a neat finish, which results in an enhanced overall look.
5) Throughout the process, the stylist applies a yellow liquid product to enhance the shine and texture of the braids, further showcasing her expertise and attention to detail.
