1) The man, dressed in a white shirt and overalls, stands on a ladder to reach the ceiling of the room, which causes him to be at the appropriate height for applying plaster.
2) Holding a large piece of plaster, he begins the process, which leads to him spreading it across the ceiling using a trowel.
3) The use of the trowel to spread the plaster evenly across the ceiling surface results in a careful and focused effort to ensure smooth application.
4) As he moves around the room, covering different sections, this action enables the entire ceiling to receive an even layer of plaster.
5) Throughout the process, his continuous smoothing with hands and the trowel directly contributes to removing any imperfections or uneven areas, leading to a finished, smooth, and even surface on the ceiling.
