1) The video shows a man in a black shirt and blue jeans removing a carpet from a room. He starts by pulling the carpet back, revealing the green floor underneath.
2) Then, he kneels down to remove the tack strip from the wall, which is used to hold the carpet in place. After that, he rolls up the carpet and secures it with tape.
3) The man then carries the rolled-up carpet out of the room, causing the space to be cleared for a new carpet.
4) A person, now wearing dark pants and a black t-shirt, is seen unrolling a large piece of light beige carpet in the same room, contrasting with the green floor beneath it.
5) Carefully, they spread out the carpet across the floor, ensuring it lies flat, which causes the room to start taking on a new appearance.
6) They then use a tool to secure the edges of the carpet, pressing down firmly to prevent any wrinkles or bubbles from forming, which results in a smooth and properly installed carpet.
