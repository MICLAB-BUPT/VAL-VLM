1) The video shows a man and a woman, with the man in a white bunny costume and the woman in a blue jacket and black pants, sitting on a snow tube at the top of a snowy hill. 
2) They are holding hands and smiling as they prepare to go down the hill, which causes them to start sliding together.
3) As they slide down, the man's bunny costume becomes more visible, and he appears to be enjoying the ride, while the woman is also having fun, laughing and smiling.
4) However, the bunny-costumed person (the man) starts to struggle slightly as they descend, indicating that the ride may not be as smooth for him as it is for the woman.
5) At the bottom of the hill, near some trees and a netted fence, they come to a stop, causing the man to get off his tube first, followed by the woman.
6) When standing up, the man, still in the bunny costume, appears to be in some discomfort or pain, while both of them look around, seemingly satisfied with their ride despite the minor issue.
