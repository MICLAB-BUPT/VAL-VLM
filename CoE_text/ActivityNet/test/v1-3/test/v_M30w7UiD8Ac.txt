1) The video begins with a woman painting an old dresser in a room, which is caused by her intention to restore it.
2) She is wearing gloves and using a paintbrush to apply the green paint, indicating her preparation and the specific color choice for the restoration.
3) The dresser is located near a window, and there are other pieces of furniture in the room, providing context to the setting of her activity.
