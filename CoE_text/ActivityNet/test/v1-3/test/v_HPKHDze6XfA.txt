1) The video begins with a view of a snow-covered car parked in a snowy parking lot, indicating heavy snowfall as the cause for the car and surroundings being covered in snow.
2) A person wearing a brown jacket and black pants walks up to the car, which leads to them starting to clear the snow off the windshield using a brush, because the visibility through the windshield is obstructed by snow.
3) They continue to brush the snow off the car, moving from the windshield to the side windows and doors, aiming to ensure that all necessary areas for driving are clear of snow, which is caused by the need for safe and legal operation of the vehicle.
4) After clearing the snow, the person gets into the car and closes the door, then opens the driver's side window and looks outside, likely to check if there is any remaining snow or ice that needs to be removed, caused by a desire to ensure the car is fully prepared for driving.
5) Finally, they get out of the car and start brushing the snow off the hood and roof of the car, because leaving snow on these parts can be dangerous while driving, potentially causing it to slide down and obstruct the view again.
