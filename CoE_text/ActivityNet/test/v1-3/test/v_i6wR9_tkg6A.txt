1) The video showcases a man in a green shirt and cap carving a watermelon to create a turtle-themed Halloween decoration, which causes him to start the process by cutting the top of the watermelon.
2) Cutting the top of the watermelon allows him to remove the insides, which then leads to drawing a turtle face on the watermelon with a marker.
3) After drawing the turtle's face, he proceeds to carve out the design, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and shell pattern, which results in the creation of the turtle's detailed appearance.
4) Once the carving is completed, he places a small light inside the watermelon, causing it to illuminate from within, thus creating a glowing effect for the final product.
