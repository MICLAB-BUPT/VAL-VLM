1) The video begins with a snowy landscape where a helicopter is preparing for takeoff, causing a person in a green jacket and helmet, holding a snowboard, to stand next to it.
2) The helicopter takes off, flying over a snowy mountain range, which leads to the scene inside the helicopter showing people wearing winter gear and helmets.
3) This flight over the snowy terrain causes the group of people on skis to be positioned on a snowy slope, ready to ski down the mountain.
4) One person in a green jacket skis down the slope, followed by another person in an orange jacket, leading to various shots of people skiing and snowboarding down the slopes with the sun shining brightly.
5) The enjoyment and showcasing of their skills while navigating through the snow-covered terrain eventually lead to the conclusion of the video with a black screen displaying the text 'CMH HELI SKIING' and 'CMHSKI.COM'.
