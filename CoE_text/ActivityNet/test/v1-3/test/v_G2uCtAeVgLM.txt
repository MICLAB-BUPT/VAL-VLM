1) The video begins with a close-up of the woman's hands braiding her hair, followed by a shot of a smartphone displaying images of women with different hairstyles.
2) This causes the scene to transition to the woman sitting in front of a bed, where she adjusts her hair and prepares for a tutorial.
3) She then uses a pink hairbrush to comb through her long brown hair, which leads to her sectioning it off.
4) After sectioning, she starts braiding her hair, adding black hair ties to secure the braid, resulting in a messy side braid.
5) The completion of the braid causes her to use a red curling iron to curl sections of her hair, following on-screen instructions to curl away from the face.
6) Once the curls are formed, she lightly brushes them with a black brush, leading to her using a pink canister labeled 'spray & play harder' to set the curls.
7) Finally, she sprays hairspray onto her hair to ensure the style stays in place, causing the video to conclude with her smiling at the camera and expressing gratitude to the viewers.
