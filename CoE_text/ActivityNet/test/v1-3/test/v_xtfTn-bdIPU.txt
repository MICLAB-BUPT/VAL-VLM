1) The video features a person in a wetsuit preparing to engage in a water sport, which is wakeboarding, not water skiing.
2) The person, wearing a black and green wetsuit with a life vest, holds onto a tow rope that is attached to a sailboat, causing the boat to start moving and pull him through the sea.
3) As the sailboat, with its white sail marked 'ZAI', moves steadily across the calm sea, the wakeboarder is pulled along, leading to the performance of various maneuvers, such as carving through the water and creating splashes.
4) The vibrant colors of the blue sea, contrasting against the white sail and the colorful attire of the wakeboarder, enhance the visual appeal of the scene, which takes place under a partly cloudy sky.
