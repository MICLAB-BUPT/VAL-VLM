1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'RAPID ROOF VENTS' and 'INSTALLATION GUIDE' on an orange background, followed by a list of items in the 'PACK CONTENTS'.
2) A person wearing gloves is shown holding a cardboard box labeled 'Redland Rapid Roof Vent', which contains various components like roof tiles, a vent cover, and a vent base.
3) The person opens the box, revealing the components, and proceeds to measure and mark the roof tile using a transparent plastic template and a pencil, ensuring precise placement of the vent.
4) They measure and mark the roof tile, then place a piece of grid-like material over it and secure it with nails, which prepares the surface for the vent installation.
5) Next, they align and fit a black vent pipe into the marked hole on the roof tile, ensuring it fits properly, which causes the vent to be correctly positioned.
6) Finally, the person places a brown roof tile over the vent pipe, securing it in place, and completes the installation process by placing the vent cover onto the roof tiles, securing it in place.
