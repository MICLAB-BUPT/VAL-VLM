1) The video begins with a wooden table placed on a white cushion against a red background, which then transitions to the same table in a disassembled state on a black surface.
2) This setup change causes the person's hands to become visible, and they start assembling the table by attaching a wooden piece to the base.
3) After securing one side, the person attaches another wooden piece to the other side of the base, forming an L-shape, which leads to the placement of a wooden plank horizontally across the base to create a tabletop.
4) The adjustment and securing of the plank result in the completion of the table assembly.
5) Once assembled, the person lifts the table and folds it in half, demonstrating its portability, which enables them to place the folded table into a green fabric bag.
6) The act of placing the table into the bag is followed by closing the bag and carrying it away, leading to the conclusion of the demonstration.
7) Finally, the display of the "SamaDhiCushions.com" logo on a white background signifies the end of the video.
