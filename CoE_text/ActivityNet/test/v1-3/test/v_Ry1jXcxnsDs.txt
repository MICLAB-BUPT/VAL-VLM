1) The video begins with a snowy scene featuring a person in red skiing gear, which then transitions to an indoor setting, causing the focus to shift to the process of ski preparation.
2) In the indoor setting, a man wearing a red apron is seen preparing the ski by first applying wax remover, which causes the old wax and dirt on the ski base to be removed.
3) After the wax removal, the man uses sandpaper to smooth the surface, which causes the ski base to become even and ready for the next step.
4) Following the smoothing, he applies anti-icing spray to the base of the ski, which causes the ski to be protected against ice buildup during use. 
5) Throughout the video, text overlays provide instructions for each step of the process, which helps the viewer understand and follow along with the ski maintenance being demonstrated.
