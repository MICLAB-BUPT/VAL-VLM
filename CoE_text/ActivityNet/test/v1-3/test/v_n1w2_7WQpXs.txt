1) The video begins with a white screen transitioning to a logo animation for 'Ultra sport' in red and black text, which causes the scene to shift to a woman in a blue top and black leggings kneeling on the floor against a pink background, holding a hula hoop.
2) The woman demonstrates how to assemble the hula hoop by connecting its segments, which are blue with red and yellow accents, causing her to stand up, now holding the fully assembled hula hoop around her waist.
3) She starts spinning the hula hoop around her waist, leading to her performing various tricks, including lifting it above her head and spinning it around her arm while maintaining balance, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the hula hoop.
4) The demonstration of these tricks and the continuous motion of the hula hoop, maintained by the rhythmic movement of her hips and arms, results in the conclusion of the video with the 'Ultra sport' logo animation once more.
