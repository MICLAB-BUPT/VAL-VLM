1) The video begins with a view of a room where a red and black rowing machine is placed on a wooden floor, causing the setting to be established for an exercise.
2) A person wearing beige shorts and a white tank top enters the frame, sits down on the rowing machine, and adjusts their position by placing their feet into the footrests and securing them with straps, which prepares him for the workout.
3) The individual then grabs the handle attached to the machine and starts performing a rowing exercise, pulling the handle towards his body while extending his legs and then pushing back to the starting position, initiating the actual workout.
4) This rowing motion is repeated several times throughout the video, allowing the man to maintain a steady rhythm and consistent motion during his workout session.
5) After completing his workout, he dismounts from the machine, showcasing the end of his exercise routine, thus concluding the activity.
