1) A shirtless man in black shorts with red stripes is washing a black Toyota BJ40 LandCruiser, which has a prominent front grille, large headlights, and a robust build, with a hose. The vehicle also has a white and black graphic design on its hood and the words 'Tigre' and 'Cristo' written on it.
2) The man uses the red hose to spray water on the vehicle's front, including the headlights and grille, causing the dirt and debris to be washed away.
3) He then uses a white cloth to wipe down the vehicle's surface, ensuring that all areas are cleaned, which further removes any remaining dirt or water marks.
4) The vehicle is parked outdoors, surrounded by greenery, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting, and the overcast weather provides soft natural lighting, making the cleaning process more effective without harsh shadows.
5) The man moves methodically around the car, spraying and wiping, which ensures a thorough and even clean of the entire vehicle.
