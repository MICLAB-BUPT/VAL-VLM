1) The video shows a man in a red shirt and black pants working on changing a tire at a well-equipped garage.
2) He starts by removing the old tire from the car, which causes him to proceed with the next steps of tire replacement.
3) After removing the old tire, he uses a machine to remove the rubber from the rim, preparing it for the new tire.
4) Then, he puts a new tire on the rim and carefully aligns the tire with the rim, causing him to secure it in place using the tire changer machine.
5) Once the new tire is mounted onto the rim, he secures it with bolts using a tool, which leads him to use a power tool to tighten the lug nuts on the wheel.
6) The tightening of the lug nuts ensures that the wheel is firmly attached to the car, completing the tire change.
