1) The video begins with a person standing in front of a red background, wearing a black t-shirt with a red dinosaur graphic and the text 'I'm happy because I know Jesus loves me.'
2) The scene then transitions to a dark background where a carved pumpkin is illuminated from within, casting an eerie glow, and a person's face is partially visible next to the pumpkin.
3) This introduction causes the setting to shift to a garage where the person starts the process of carving a pumpkin.
4) The person uses their feet to hold the pumpkin steady, which allows them to cut out its top and scoop out the seeds and pulp.
5) After removing the insides, the person draws on the pumpkin with a marker, creating a design, which prepares the pumpkin for the actual carving.
6) They then carve out the design using a knife, following the pattern they have drawn.
7) Finally, the person cleans up the pumpkin scraps and places the carved pumpkin in a dark room, which creates a spooky atmosphere.
