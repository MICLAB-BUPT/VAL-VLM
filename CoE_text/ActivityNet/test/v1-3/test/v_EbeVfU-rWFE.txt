1) The video showcases a woman with blonde hair styled in loose waves, wearing a floral top and hoop earrings, who is demonstrating how to create an updo hairstyle.
2) She starts by applying a golden bottle of hair product to her hair, which causes her hair to be more manageable and easier to style.
3) After applying the hair product, she uses a comb and hairpins to section off her hair, which allows her to have better control over the sections as she styles.
4) The woman then braids sections of her hair, securing them with pins as she goes along, which leads to the creation of a structured base for the updo.
5) She carefully twists and secures the braids into place, which results in a neat and elegant updo.
6) Throughout the process, she adjusts and styles her hair to ensure it looks polished and well-arranged, which contributes to the overall elegance of the final look.
