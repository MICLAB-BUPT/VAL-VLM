1) The video features a woman with curly hair in a bathroom setting, wearing glasses and a white shirt, demonstrating a hair care routine.
2) She starts by showing her wet, curly hair, which causes her to apply a product from a jar onto her hair using her hands to work the product through, ensuring even distribution.
3) After applying the product, she introduces a hair dryer with a diffuser attachment, causing her to demonstrate how to use it on her hair while carefully adjusting the settings.
4) Throughout the process, she dries her hair while using the diffuser, which causes her to occasionally touch her hair to check its texture and condition, ensuring that all sections of her hair are dried thoroughly.
