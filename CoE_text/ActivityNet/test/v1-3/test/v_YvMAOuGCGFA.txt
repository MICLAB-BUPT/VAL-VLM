1) The video starts with a man standing in a kitchen, wearing a gray shirt and khaki shorts, and he is next to a sink with visible stains and grime.
2) The presence of the stains and grime on the sink causes the man to begin the cleaning process by spraying the sink with Ajax cleaner.
3) After spraying, he uses a yellow sponge to scrub the surface, focusing on different areas of the sink to ensure thorough cleaning.
4) His thorough scrubbing of the sink leads him to rinse it with water from the faucet, removing all the foam and dirt.
5) Once the sink is rinsed, the man dries the sink with a red cloth, making sure it's completely clean and dry, which is the final step in his cleaning process.
