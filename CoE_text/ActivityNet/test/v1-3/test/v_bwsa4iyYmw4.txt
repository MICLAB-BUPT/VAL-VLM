1) The video begins with a woman standing in a bathroom, wearing a white tank top and shorts, and her long brown hair is wet from washing.
2) She starts by drying her hair with a white towel, which causes her hair to become less wet and more manageable.
3) After drying, she applies hair products to her hair, such as shampoo, conditioner, and styling cream, which prepares her hair for styling and helps in creating the desired look.
4) She uses a comb to detangle and style her hair, and sections it off using a hair clip, allowing her to work on specific parts of her hair more effectively.
5) The woman then blow-dries her hair, focusing on different sections to achieve curls, which sets the shape and adds volume to her hairstyle.
6) Once her hair is dry and styled, she sprays hairspray onto her hair, which holds the curls in place and provides added texture and volume.
7) Finally, she showcases the finished curls, displaying them from different angles, to present the completed hairstyle.
