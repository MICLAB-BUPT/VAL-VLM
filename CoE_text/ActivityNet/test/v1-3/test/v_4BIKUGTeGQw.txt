1) Heavy rainfall caused the road to flood.
2) The flooded road created an environment suitable for wakeboarding, causing the individual to decide to wakeboard in this unconventional setting.
3) The individual put on a green life vest and black pants, which were chosen to ensure safety and comfort while wakeboarding in the flooded area.
4) The person held onto a yellow tow rope, which was attached to an unseen vehicle (likely a boat), enabling them to be pulled through the water.
5) The overcast, grey skies indicated recent or ongoing rain, which caused the wet and reflective condition of the roads and the fast-flowing, murky water.
6) The presence of grassy banks, trees, and buildings in the background provided a natural and urban context for the wakeboarding activity.
7) The strong currents and fast-flowing water required the wakeboarder to skillfully navigate, causing them to demonstrate control and expertise as they glided over the water and created splashes.
