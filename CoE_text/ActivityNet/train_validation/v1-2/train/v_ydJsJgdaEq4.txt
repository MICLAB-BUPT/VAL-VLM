1) A man in a straw hat and plaid shirt stands on a porch, holding a spray bottle and a blue cloth.

3) He starts by spraying the window with the cleaning solution, then he uses the cloth to wipe the window in circular motions, causing the dirt and grime on the window to be removed.
4) He repeats this process several times, showing the effectiveness of the spray, which results in the window becoming clean.
