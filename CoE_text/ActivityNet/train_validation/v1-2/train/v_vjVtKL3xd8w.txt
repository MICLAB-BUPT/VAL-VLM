1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the tutorial on styling short locs using soft spike curlers, causing the viewer to understand the content and purpose of the video.
2) A person, who is shown sitting on a couch and then later standing in front of a white towel, starts demonstrating the process, which causes the audience to follow the steps visually and clearly.
3) The demonstrator uses a black hair clipper, running it through their hair, which causes the preparation for sectioning and styling the locs.
4) The person transitions into parting and sectioning off a portion of their hair with a black comb, which causes an organized approach to styling, ensuring each section is manageable and ready for styling.
5) Wrapping the sectioned hair around the clipper and securing it in place, as demonstrated, causes the formation of the desired soft spike curls.
6) Throughout, detailed instructions and visual demonstrations are provided, causing the viewers to learn and possibly replicate the technique on their own.
7) In another part of the video, the same or a different individual, a woman with short, curly hair, demonstrates how to style her hair using a comb, causing a variation in the styling method presented.
8) By parting her hair in the middle and creating a smooth, straight line along the part, she prepares the hair for twisting, which causes a neat base for the hairstyle.
9) Using her fingers to separate the hair into sections and twist each section tightly, the woman creates tight, neat twists, which causes a well-organized and aesthetically pleasing hairstyle.
10) Finally, by showing off her finished hairstyle, consisting of evenly spaced, tight twists, she showcases the end result, causing inspiration and satisfaction among the viewers.
