1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the logo and contact information for 'Parish Supply' and 'Prestige,' followed by a green background with white text reading 'Indoor Window Cleaning.'
2) A man in a high-visibility vest (later specified as yellow) is shown standing near a glass door, placing a mat on the floor to protect it from water damage, which causes the initiation of the cleaning process.
3) He removes liquid from a green bucket using a white cloth, then applies soapy water to the glass with a white roller, causing the glass to be prepped for cleaning.
4) The man carefully cleans the glass, ensuring not to touch the frame edges, which causes the prevention of water or soap from damaging the frame.
5) He uses a squeegee to remove excess water, starting from the top and moving downwards, which causes the glass to become free of streaks and excess liquid.
6) The man continues to clean the glass methodically, moving from top to bottom, and finally wipes away any residue with a clean cloth, causing the glass to be completely clean and clear.
7) The video concludes with the man standing up and walking away from the glass door, leaving the area clean and tidy, which is the result of his thorough and careful cleaning process.
