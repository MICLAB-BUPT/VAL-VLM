1) The video shows a woman smoking a cigarette while driving, which causes the camera to focus on different parts of her as she engages in this activity.
2) The act of her smoking leads to the camera capturing close-ups of her hands holding the cigarette and bringing it to her mouth to take a puff.
3) Her operation of the vehicle while smoking causes the camera to also show her feet as she manages the pedals, providing a view of how she balances both actions.
4) The shifting of the camera angle between her hands, feet, and face is caused by the desire to fully capture the details of her multitasking, including the moments when she takes a drag from the cigarette.
5) The dim lighting, suggesting nighttime or a poorly lit area, contributes to the overall mood and setting, which may cause an increased focus on the illuminated end of the cigarette and the driver's movements.
