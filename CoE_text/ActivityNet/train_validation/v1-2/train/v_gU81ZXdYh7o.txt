1) A young boy wearing an orange t-shirt and red shorts is practicing boxing in a room.
2) The presence of a black punching bag with the word 'TRAIN' written on it causes the boy to throw punches at it.
3) The boy's intention to improve his boxing skills causes him to move around the bag, throwing jabs and hooks.
4) The setting, which includes a concrete floor and various pieces of furniture and equipment such as a weight bench and a chair, indicates that the room is likely a makeshift or personal training area, which facilitates the boy's practice.
5) The natural lighting coming from windows or openings in the room enables the boy to see clearly, thereby supporting his boxing practice.
