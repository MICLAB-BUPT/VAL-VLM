1) The video shows a person demonstrating how to use a label maker to create and apply labels, which causes them to first peel off a label from the sheet.
2) After peeling off the backing of the label sheet, the person uses a black marker to write 'Mabel's' on it, causing the label to be personalized.
3) The writing on the label with a black marker causes the person to then place the label onto a pink sock.
4) Placing the label onto the sock causes the person to press it down firmly to ensure initial adhesion.
5) To ensure the label adheres properly, the person then uses an iron to apply heat to the label, which causes the label to bond more securely to the sock.
6) After applying heat, the person removes the label's protective layer, if present, revealing a clean and smooth application, which concludes the demonstration.
