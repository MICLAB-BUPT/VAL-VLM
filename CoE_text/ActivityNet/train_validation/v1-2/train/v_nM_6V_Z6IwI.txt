1) The video begins with a person standing in a bathroom, facing the camera. They are shirtless and have short hair. The bathroom has white walls, a towel hanging on a rack to the left of the frame, and a stuffed animal visible on the door behind the person.
2) The person moves their head from side to side, then covers their face with their hands before quickly moving out of the frame, which leads to the camera showing the empty bathroom for a few moments.
3) The person re-enters the frame from the bottom of the screen, causing them to be seen washing their face by splashing water on it, rubbing it with their hands, and then rinsing off the water.
