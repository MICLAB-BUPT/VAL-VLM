1) The person's hand, with unpainted nails, enters the frame holding a bottle of purple nail polish labeled 'China Glaze', which causes them to start the process of applying nail polish.
2) They begin by applying the polish to their nails, following on-screen instructions that appear in white text, which causes them to use the brush carefully and ensure even coverage.
3) The instructions include lightly using the brush three times across each nail, letting the brush do the work, painting all the way up to the cuticle, and not leaving a tiny gap, which causes the person to be meticulous and avoid getting any polish on their skin.
4) After the first coat, they mention needing a second coat for better results, which causes them to apply another layer of polish.
5) The video concludes with the person showing off their freshly painted nails and encouraging viewers to practice for perfect results, which is caused by the successful completion of the nail polishing process.
