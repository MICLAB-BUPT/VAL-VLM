1) The video features a woman with long, wavy hair wearing a white top and denim shorts, causing her to be the main subject of the footage.
2) She is seated in front of an electronic keyboard, which leads to her playing it with her hands, moving across the keys and pressing them in various combinations to create music.
3) The background, being a plain wall with a window covered by blinds, results in the focus remaining on the woman and the keyboard, as the camera remains stationary, concentrating on her upper body and the piano keyboard.
4) The lighting from an overhead source casting soft shadows behind the woman contributes to the overall visual effect, emphasizing her focused expression while playing the keyboard.
