1) A person is attempting to split a log with an axe in an outdoor setting, which causes the individual to focus on the task at hand and swing the axe with considerable force towards the log placed upright on the ground.
2) The man swings the axe down onto a piece of wood on the ground, causing it to split into smaller pieces, and this action is repeated multiple times.
3) After splitting, the man bends over to pick up the split pieces, placing them back on the ground for further chopping, which leads to the continuous process of wood chopping.
