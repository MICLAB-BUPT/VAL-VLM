1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'How To Paint Seascape with acrylic paint' on a blue background, which then transitions to a painting of a seascape, showing a cloudy sky and distant mountains.
2) A hand holding a paintbrush appears, causing the addition of blue paint to the bottom of the canvas, creating the impression of water.
3) The camera zooms in on the painting, focusing on the brush strokes as the artist adds more details to the water, leading to the person's hand movements being visible as they carefully apply the paint, blending colors and creating texture.
4) Text overlays appear intermittently, providing instructions such as 'For complete painting see all parts' and 'To see how to paint this complete painting watch all parts', which guides the viewer through the process.
5) The video concludes with a thank you message on a blue background, marking the end of the demonstration.
