1) The young boy, dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, is playing with a sports equipment (cricket bat in Answer 1, hockey stick in Answer 2) and a small ball indoors.
2) The choice of the sport causes a slight difference in the specific actions: in the first scenario, he swings the cricket bat to hit the ball, while in the second, he uses the hockey stick to move the ball around.
3) The setting for both scenarios is the same - a living room that contains a television, a couch, and other furniture, which implies that the boy is utilizing the available space for his play.
4) The boy's enthusiasm and engagement in the activity cause him to follow the ball's movement around the room, indicating an active and dynamic play session in both cases.
