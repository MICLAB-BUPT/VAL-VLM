1) The video begins with a colorful title screen displaying the words "Retromercials Revisited" in bold, stylized letters against a vibrant background, which causes it to transition to a black-and-white scene.
2) In the black-and-white scene, a hand reaches into a basket of peaches and picks one up, causing the focus to shift to a close-up of a hand holding a spiky hairbrush, followed by a vintage Remington 60 electric shaver being opened from its case.
3) A man is shown using the shaver on his face, demonstrating its functionality, which leads to him holding the razor in his right hand and using it to shave his cheeks, chin, and mustache, resulting in his facial hair being neatly trimmed, and he has a clean-shaven look by the end of the video.
4) The demonstration of the shaver's effectiveness in removing peach fuzz, as well as its use for grooming a spiky hairbrush, causes the final frames to show the Remington 60 shaver being placed back into its case, with a hand closing the lid.
5) The video concludes with a black screen displaying credits, including the voice actor's name and the website "www.aymanimation.com," as a result of all the previous demonstrations and actions.
