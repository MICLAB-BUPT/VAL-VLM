1) The woman starts by standing behind a table in an office setting, surrounded by various items including a basket filled with decorative objects, a hairdryer, and shelves with colorful ribbons and boxes.
2) She begins to explain the process of shrink-wrapping the basket, which causes her to pick up a large piece of clear plastic wrap and place it over the basket, ensuring all sides are covered.
3) To make the plastic wrap conform to the shape of the basket, she uses a purple hairdryer to heat the plastic, causing it to shrink.
4) She carefully moves the hairdryer around the basket, making sure the plastic wrap is evenly heated and tightly sealed, which results in the plastic shrinking uniformly.
5) This process ends with the basket fully wrapped in clear plastic wrap, showcasing the final product: a beautifully wrapped gift basket.
