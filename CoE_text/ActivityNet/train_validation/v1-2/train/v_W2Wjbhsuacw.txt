1) The video begins with a person standing in front of a metal bucket filled with wood, which is placed on the ground.
2) The man, wearing a black shirt and dark pants, holds a gas canister in his right hand, causing him to use it to ignite the wood inside the bucket.
3) As the fire starts, it quickly grows larger and more intense, with flames reaching high into the air, because he continues to pour gas onto the fire.
4) This action of adding more gas creates a large, intense blaze that illuminates the surrounding area.
5) The person then uses a fire extinguisher to control the fire, ensuring that it remains contained within the bucket, as a result of the fire's growth.
6) The video ends with the fire still burning brightly inside the bucket.
