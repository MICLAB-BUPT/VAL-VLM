1) The video starts with the ingredients, including spaghetti, fresh herbs, and smoked salmon, being laid out, which causes the viewers to understand what will be needed for the recipe.
2) The process of preparing the pasta begins by boiling it in salted water, causing the pasta to become al dente, ready for the next steps.
3) Once the pasta is cooked, it is drained, leading to the removal of excess water, which prepares the pasta for mixing with other ingredients.
4) The drained pasta is mixed with cream cheese, causing a creamy base to form, which will enhance the flavor and texture of the dish.
5) Smoked salmon is added to the pasta, adding a rich, smoky flavor that complements the creaminess of the cheese, thus enriching the overall taste of the dish.
6) Lemon juice and black pepper are then added, resulting in a balance of flavors, with the lemon providing a tangy contrast to the richness of the salmon and cream cheese, while the black pepper adds a slight spiciness.
7) The dish is completed by garnishing with fresh herbs, which not only enhances the visual appeal but also adds a fresh, aromatic element to the final presentation.
