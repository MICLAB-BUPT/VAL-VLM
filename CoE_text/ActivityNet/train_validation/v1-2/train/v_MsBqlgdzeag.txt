1) The video begins with a shot of a tree stump in an outdoor setting, surrounded by leaves and dirt.
2) A person wearing a yellow shirt and blue shorts enters the frame, holding an axe, which causes them to start chopping the tree stump into smaller pieces, splitting it into two halves.
3) The person picks up one half of the stump and places it on the ground, leading to further chopping of the stump, splitting it into even smaller pieces.
4) The person then approaches the remaining part of the stump, picks up a piece of wood, and positions it on top of the stump, causing them to swing the axe and split the wood into smaller pieces.
5) This process is repeated several times, resulting in the wood being fully split.
6) The video ends with a shot of the chopped stump pieces scattered on the ground, as a consequence of the person's continuous action of splitting the wood.
