2) The dog is interacting with various objects on the table, such as a plate of food, a mug, and a napkin, which leads to it appearing to eat from the plate using a fork and drink from the mug, mimicking human behavior.
3) The person (in this context, the dog acting as a person) in the video is seen engaging in various activities, initially holding a mug and drinking from it, which then results in them using a spoon to scoop food from a plate onto another plate.
