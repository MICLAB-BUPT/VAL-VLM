1) The video starts with a title card introducing the recipe for pasta al dente, which causes the woman in a blue top to begin her cooking demonstration.
2) The scene transitions to a close-up of a pot on a stove where water is being boiled, and this leads to the woman adding salt and pasta to the boiling water.
3) After the woman adds the pasta, she sets a timer for 10 minutes, causing her to stir the pasta occasionally during this period.
4) When the timer goes off, it prompts the woman to remove the pasta from the pot, which she then places into a white bowl (or onto a plate as per the second answer).
5) Finally, the completion of the pasta preparation causes the woman to gesture towards (or wave goodbye to) the camera, concluding her cooking demonstration.
