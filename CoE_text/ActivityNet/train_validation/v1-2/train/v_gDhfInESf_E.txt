1) The video features a person with long, dark hair in a dimly lit environment, which causes the focus to be primarily on the hair and the brushing action.
2) The lighting setup highlights the texture and movement of the hair as it's being brushed, causing the background to remain out of focus throughout the sequence.
3) The person is seen holding the brush in their right hand, which leads them to move it through their hair, starting from the top and working their way down to the ends.
4) They are using their left hand to hold sections of their hair while brushing, which allows for a more controlled and thorough brushing process.
