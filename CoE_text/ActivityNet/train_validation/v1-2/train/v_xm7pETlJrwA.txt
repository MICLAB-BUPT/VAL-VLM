1) The woman in a yellow top starts by pouring water from a white pitcher into a black basin containing a piece of lingerie, which causes the basin to fill with water.
2) She then adds detergent from a pink bottle, causing the water and detergent to mix together when she uses her hands to blend them.
3) The mixing of the water and detergent leads to her being able to scrub the lingerie with a brush, focusing on the delicate fabric.
4) After scrubbing, she rinses the lingerie thoroughly under running water from the pitcher, causing the detergent and any dirt to be washed away.
5) Finally, she lays out a pink towel on the table and places the cleaned lingerie on it to dry, or alternatively, she hangs the clean lingerie on a clothing rack, ensuring they are spread out or hung properly to dry.
