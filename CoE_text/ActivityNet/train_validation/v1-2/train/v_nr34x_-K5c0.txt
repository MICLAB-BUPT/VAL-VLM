1) The man, wearing a black wetsuit and a red cap, is in an indoor swimming pool with his kayak, which is a small, single-seater model designed for training purposes.
2) He uses a double-bladed paddle to navigate through the water, lifting it out of the water and then dipping it back in to propel himself forward, causing his movements to be fluid and controlled.
3) The individual performs flips with the kayak, which causes another person in the water to assist by helping stabilize the kayak during these maneuvers.
