1) The man, dressed in a purple t-shirt, black shorts, and red shoes, approaches a barbell loaded with green and blue weight plates on the floor in a gym setting, which is equipped with various items such as weights, kettlebells, and a squat rack, and has walls adorned with framed pictures and a clock.
2) He bends down to grip the barbell, causing him to prepare for the lift by positioning his body correctly.
3) Lifting the barbell off the ground, he transitions into a squat position while holding the barbell at shoulder height, which causes the initial phase of the clean and jerk exercise to be executed.
4) From the squat position, he stands up fully, then pushes the barbell overhead, extending his arms, and possibly extending one leg for balance, which causes the completion of the jerk part of the exercise.
5) After successfully completing the lift, he drops the barbell onto the floor, which marks the end of the exercise, and then walks away.
