1) The video begins with a man, presumably a piercer, preparing to pierce a woman's ear. The woman is seated in a chair, and the piercer is seen holding a needle and other piercing tools.
2) He uses a tool to mark the spot on her earlobe, which causes the woman to prepare for the upcoming procedure.
3) The piercer carefully inserts the needle into her earlobe, causing some discomfort as indicated by her facial expressions, but the woman remains calm throughout the process.
4) After the initial piercing, he proceeds to insert a barbell through the newly created piercing hole, which results in the woman experiencing some pain.
5) The piercer then attaches a decorative earring to the new piercing, completing the procedure.
6) The woman looks at herself in the mirror, seemingly satisfied with the result, and smiles.
7) The video ends with a text overlay providing information about the piercing process and encouraging viewers to comment or message for more details.
