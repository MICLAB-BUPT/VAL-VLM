1) The man is sitting on a toilet in a bathroom, which causes him to be in a position to shave his legs.
2) The presence of a bottle of shaving cream on the white sink and the man using a razor indicates that he is prepared to and is in the process of shaving his legs.
3) The man's action of talking to someone off-camera suggests there is an ongoing conversation, which could be a reason for his multitasking by shaving while sitting on the toilet.
4) The fact that there are other people in the bathroom, although not the focus, implies that this is a casual or familiar setting where such behavior is accepted.
