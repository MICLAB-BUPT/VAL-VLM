1) The video shows an athlete practicing hammer throw in a sports field, wearing a dark tank top and shorts, and later identified as a male athlete in a blue and white uniform.
2) The athlete is inside a throwing cage with green netting, which is also described as a circular area with a protective net around it, where he holds the hammer with both hands.
3) The athlete begins to swing the hammer in a circular motion, gradually increasing its speed, causing the build-up of momentum necessary for the throw.
4) As he spins, his body rotates along with the hammer, further building momentum, which is a critical part of the technique for a successful throw.
5) After several rotations, the athlete releases the hammer, which flies through the air towards the field, marking the culmination of the practiced technique.
6) The athlete watches the hammer's trajectory before stepping out of the circle, indicating the end of that particular practice throw.
