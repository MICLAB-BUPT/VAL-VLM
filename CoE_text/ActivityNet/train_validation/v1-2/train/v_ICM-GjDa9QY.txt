1) The man in a blue shirt and jeans, standing next to a white truck with the text 'INVISIBLE WINDOWS.ca' on it, initiates the cleaning process by holding a window screen and a bottle of cleaning solution.
2) He then applies the cleaning solution to the screen, which causes the dirt and grime to become loose and easier to remove.
3) The application of the solution is followed by scrubbing the screen thoroughly with a brush, causing the dirt and debris to be dislodged from the surface of the screen.
4) After scrubbing, he rinses the screen under running water from a hose, which causes the loosened dirt and the cleaning solution to be washed away.
5) Finally, to ensure that the screen is completely dry and free of any cleaning residue, he uses a blue cloth to wipe down the screen, resulting in a clean and clear window screen.
