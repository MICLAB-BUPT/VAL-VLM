1) The man, dressed in a white t-shirt, blue shorts, and black shoes, is playing tennis on an outdoor court with green and red surfaces and white boundary lines.
2) He serves the ball by tossing it up and swinging his racket, which causes the ball to be hit over the net.
3) After serving, he walks around the court, possibly taking a break or preparing for the next point, and this action leads him to walk towards the camera while holding his racket and a water bottle.
4) As he holds the water bottle and his racket, he gestures with his hand as if explaining something, indicating that he might be discussing a technique or aspect of the game.
5) The environment, being sunny with clear skies, and the presence of trees and a fence in the background, provides a pleasant setting for his tennis practice.
