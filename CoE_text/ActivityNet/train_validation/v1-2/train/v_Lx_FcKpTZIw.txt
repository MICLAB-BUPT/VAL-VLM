1) The video shows a woman in a black top standing in front of a sink, demonstrating proper handwashing techniques. She begins by turning on the faucet and wetting her hands under running water.
2) This causes her to then apply soap from a dispenser and lather her hands thoroughly, ensuring to cover all surfaces including between fingers and the back of hands.
3) After lathering, she rinses off the soap under the running water, making sure to clean all areas.
4) This leads to her drying her hands with a paper towel, using it to turn off the faucet to avoid recontamination.
5) The environment appears to be a clinical or medical setting, indicated by the sterile-looking sink and countertop, which contrasts with the typical bathroom setting described in the second answer, but both settings provide the necessary tools for effective hand washing.
