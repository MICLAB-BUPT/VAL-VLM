1) The video begins with a title screen that reads 'How to Start a Campfire,' which transitions into a scene of a campfire pit surrounded by rocks, setting the stage for the demonstration.
2) The person places crumpled newspaper in the center of the stone circle, causing it to become the initial fuel source for the fire.
3) The person then adds small sticks around the newspaper, which will catch fire from the burning newspaper and help to sustain the flame.
4) Using a lighter, the person ignites the newspaper, and as a result, the small flame starts to grow, catching onto the surrounding sticks.
5) As the fire grows, the person continues to add more sticks and pieces of wood, ensuring that there is enough fuel to keep the fire burning steadily.
6) The careful tending and addition of more wood cause the fire to burn brighter and maintain its intensity within the confines of the rock enclosure.
