1) The video starts with a woman in a yellow top standing in front of a window, holding a sponge and a spray bottle.
2) She then pours water into a bucket, which causes her to add vinegar and squeeze the sponge into the bucket.
3) After preparing the cleaning solution, she uses a squeegee to clean the window, which is followed by drying it with a cloth.
4) The inclusion of text overlays providing tips and instructions for cleaning windows, such as using crumpled newspaper or lint-free cloths, enhances the instructional content of the video.
