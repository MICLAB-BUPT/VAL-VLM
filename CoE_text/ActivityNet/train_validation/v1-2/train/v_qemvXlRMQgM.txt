1) The video begins with a close-up of a blue glass base, which is the foundation for the hookah assembly.
2) Following this, a metallic top piece and a decorative stem are added to the base, causing the structure of the hookah to take shape.
3) A metallic bowl is then placed on top of the assembled hookah, and it's positioned onto a metallic stand, preparing it for the next steps in the process.
4) Dark tobacco is packed into the metallic bowl, setting the stage for the smoking experience.
5) Aluminum foil is wrapped around the top of the bowl, which serves as a barrier between the charcoal and the tobacco, ensuring even heating.
6) A black charcoal piece is placed on top of the aluminum foil, and it's lit using tongs and a lighter, causing the tobacco to heat up and release smoke.
7) The person, wearing yellow gloves, inhales from the hookah, thus enjoying the smoke produced by the heated tobacco, while sitting next to an open book and colorful cushions.
