1) The two children are seated on a patterned carpet in a room with light-colored walls, which causes the setting to appear as a domestic environment, possibly a living room or play area.
2) The child on the left, wearing a purple top and green pants, takes a puff from the hookah hose, which causes smoke to be exhaled into the air.
3) The child on the left then hands the hookah hose to the child on the right, who is dressed in a blue top with a cartoon character print, causing the sharing of the smoking activity to continue.
4) The natural light coming from the side illuminates the scene, which causes the absence of harsh shadows and focuses attention on the children's activity.
