2) The setting is a well-lit bar with wooden interiors and various bottles visible on the shelves, creating an inviting atmosphere for the discussion.

5) The man then places two cards face down on the bar counter, which suggests he might be demonstrating a card trick or game, further engaging the interest of the two other individuals.
