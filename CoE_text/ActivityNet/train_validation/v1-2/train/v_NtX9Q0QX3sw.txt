1) The man in a dark shirt is initially seen standing in front of a large window, holding a squeegee and cleaning the window, which involves moving the squeegee back and forth to remove water or other liquid from the glass.
2) After cleaning the window, the man's next action is applying a red curtain to the same window. He starts by positioning the curtain on the window frame to ensure it fits properly.
3) To achieve a neat appearance, the man uses a tool to smooth out the curtain, making sure there are no wrinkles or air bubbles, and he carefully adjusts the curtain to ensure it is evenly spread across the window, checking the alignment several times for a professional finish.
