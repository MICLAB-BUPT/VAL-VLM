1) The video showcases a weightlifter performing a clean and jerk lift, which causes the athlete, dressed in a red singlet and white shoes, to begin by bending down to grip the barbell loaded with large weights.
2) Gripping the barbell causes him to lift it off the ground, bringing it up to his chest level while squatting down.
3) Squatting down with the barbell at chest level causes him to then stand up, pushing the barbell above his head until his arms are fully extended.
4) Extending his arms fully above his head causes the weightlifter to hold the barbell steady for a moment before dropping it to the ground, thus completing the lift.
