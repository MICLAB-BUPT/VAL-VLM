1) The video begins with a man in a red shirt and black shorts running on a track towards a sandpit, performing a triple jump. He lands in the sandpit, then stands up and walks away.
2) This action causes the scene to transition to him standing on the track, preparing for another jump, specifically a long jump this time.
3) As he runs again, his movements are captured from various angles, including close-ups of his feet as he takes off and mid-air shots of his body position during the jump, leading to him landing in the sandpit.
4) Text appears on the screen indicating '2 step - 12'9.5"', which is a result of measuring his performance in the long jump.
5) The man repeats this action several times, each time landing in the sandpit, causing the video to cut to a close-up of the sandpit with text showing 'Standing 35ft 10.70m'.
6) After multiple attempts, the man is seen sitting on the ground, talking and gesturing with his hands, indicating a break or the end of his practice session, while another person briefly appears behind him.
7) Finally, the man walking away from the camera, coupled with the appearance of the word 'BYE!' on the screen, signifies the conclusion of the video.
