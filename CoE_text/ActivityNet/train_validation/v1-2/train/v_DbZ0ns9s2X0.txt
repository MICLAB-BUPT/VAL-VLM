1) The video begins with a title screen, which transitions to show paint jars and a flat brush, setting the stage for the tutorial.
2) The demonstration starts, causing the artist to use the flat brush and paints on a white sheet of paper.
3) The artist dips the brush into different colors, such as red and green, leading to the creation of petal-like shapes and stems on the paper.
4) The hand is seen painting red flowers and adding details with a smaller brush, resulting in a pattern of flowers and green stems across the paper.
5) The steady and controlled movements of the artist's hand during the application of paint cause the artwork to display precision and skill.
6) The completion of the floral design leads to a close-up view of the finished piece, followed by a 'Thanks For Like Thanks For Subscribe' message over the logo 'JK Arts'.
