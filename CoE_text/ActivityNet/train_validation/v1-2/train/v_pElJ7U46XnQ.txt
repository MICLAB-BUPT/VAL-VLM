1) A male athlete in a black singlet and knee wraps prepares to lift a barbell loaded with red plates at a weightlifting competition, which is held in an indoor gym with a 'USA Weightlifting' banner and a digital scoreboard showing 'Danny Stronger' from California.
2) The lifter chalks his hands, grips the barbell, and adjusts his stance and grip on the barbell, causing him to be ready for the lift.
3) He then performs the clean by lifting the barbell from the ground to his shoulders, followed by the jerk phase where he pushes the barbell overhead while splitting his legs into a lunge position, leading to the successful completion of the lift.
4) After successfully completing the lift, he drops the barbell, and this action allows him to celebrate by raising his arms in victory.
5) Another individual approaches with a large black box, possibly containing equipment or additional weights, which suggests preparation for the next lift.
