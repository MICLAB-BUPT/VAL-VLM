1) The video begins with a close-up view of a wooden floor.
2) A vacuum cleaner is then used to clean the floor, moving back and forth across the surface, which causes the camera to follow its movement.
3) As the vacuum cleaner moves, it causes a black cat to appear on the floor; the cat is lying down and seems to be enjoying the vacuum cleaner's movement.
4) The person operating the vacuum cleaner continues to move it around the cat, ensuring not to disturb the cat, which remains relaxed and comfortable.
5) The person transitions from cleaning the wooden floor to the carpeted area, continuing the use of the vacuum cleaner.
6) After cleaning both types of flooring, the person uses the vacuum cleaner to groom the black cat, carefully vacuuming around the cat's body and head without causing any disturbance.
7) The video ends with the vacuum cleaner still in motion, cleaning the floor around the cat.
