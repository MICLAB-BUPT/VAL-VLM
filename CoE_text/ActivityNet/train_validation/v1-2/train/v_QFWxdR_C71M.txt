1) The video begins with the artist holding a white pencil, which causes the initial sketch of the outline on the canvas.
2) After the outline is completed, the artist uses a paintbrush to apply a base layer of white paint, which prepares the surface for color application.
3) The application of yellow and orange paint by the artist causes the gradual formation of the shape of an orange, adding depth and texture.
4) The use of blue paint by the artist to create a background enhances the contrast with the orange, making the subject more prominent.
5) The artist's continuous refinement of details, including the addition of highlights and shadows, causes the orange to appear more realistic.
6) Throughout the process, the precise strokes and adjustments made by the artist cause the enhancement of the overall realism and vibrancy of the artwork.
