1) The young girl is dressed in a green tank top and striped shorts, which cause her to be comfortably attired for the physical activity of playing hopscotch.
2) The hopscotch grid, drawn with white lines and numbered from 1 to 10 on an asphalt surface, causes the girl to have a clear path and sequence to follow as she plays.
3) The outdoor setting near a building with brick walls and windows, combined with the daytime lighting, provides a suitable and safe environment for the girl, causing her to play hopscotch freely.
4) As the girl hops through the squares, following the rules of the game, this action demonstrates her skill and balance, indicating that she has practiced or is familiar with the game, thereby causing her to enjoy and engage in the activity effectively.
