1) The video begins with a man and woman standing in a kitchen, with the man holding a pineapple, which causes him to start demonstrating how to cut it.
2) The man then proceeds to cut off the top of the pineapple and removes the leafy crown, causing the pineapple to be prepared for further slicing.
3) He then cuts the pineapple in half lengthwise and removes the core, leading to the creation of two halves ready for more detailed cutting.
4) The man slices the pineapple into smaller pieces, removing the eyes from each slice, which results in clean, edible portions.
5) Throughout the process, the woman stands beside him, observing his actions and occasionally glancing at the camera, indicating her engagement and interest in the demonstration.
6) The video ends with the man placing the sliced pineapple on a plate, causing the completion of the demonstration.
