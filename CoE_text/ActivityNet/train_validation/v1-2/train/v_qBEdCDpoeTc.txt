1) The video begins with a title screen introducing 'The MO SATARA Throwing System with Cody Riffle,' which then transitions to an indoor sports facility.
2) In the facility, a man in athletic attire, specifically a dark shirt and shorts, is seen practicing throwing techniques, causing the scene to focus on his actions.
3) The man performs a series of spins and throws within a caged area, leading to text overlays providing instructions such as 'Start with letting the ball & left arm 'wrap' around the body,' 'Keep BOTH knees bent,' and 'Move the weight from the right to the left as hard as possible! Keep knees bent.'
4) Following these instructions, the man demonstrates the throwing motion step by step, resulting in a detailed showcase of the technique.
5) The man, wearing a dark blue shirt and black shorts, starts by swinging the hammer around his body, gradually increasing the speed of the rotation, which causes his movements to become more fluid and powerful, showcasing his technique and strength.
6) As he spins, the man releases the hammer, causing it to fly through the air before landing outside the frame, thus completing the demonstration.
7) The video concludes with another title screen displaying 'MO SATARA Throws Coach University of Michigan' and an email address, which then fades to black, ending the instructional video.
