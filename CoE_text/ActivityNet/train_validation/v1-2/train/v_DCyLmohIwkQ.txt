1) The video begins with a man in a blue shirt and black pants entering a room filled with traditional Chinese artifacts, which causes him to approach a wooden stand holding a bow and arrow.
2) Carefully examining the bow and arrow leads to the scene transitioning to the man walking outside on a stone path surrounded by autumn leaves, carrying his bow and arrows.
3) Carrying his equipment outside results in him arriving at an outdoor archery range, where he prepares to shoot arrows at a target.
4) At the archery range, the man starts by picking up an arrow from the ground, which causes him to proceed to load it onto his bow.
5) Loading the arrow onto his bow leads to him aiming at a target board, after which he releases the arrow, hitting the bullseye.
6) Successfully hitting the target encourages the man to retrieve another arrow and repeat the process, successfully hitting the target again.
7) Demonstrating his archery skills by aiming and shooting multiple arrows with precision leads to the conclusion of the video, with the man retrieving his arrows from the target.
8) Retrieving his arrows from the target causes him to return to the indoor setting, placing his bow and arrows on a wooden table.
