1) The video depicts a woman lying on her back, seemingly in a relaxed or sedated state, on a black surface, possibly a bed or couch, with her belly exposed.
2) A person wearing black gloves is seen performing a procedure on the woman's lower abdomen area, specifically a piercing procedure on the woman's navel.
3) The gloved individual uses a tool to create an incision and then inserts a piece of jewelry into the piercing hole, which causes the woman to remain in a relaxed state throughout the process.
4) The setting seems to be indoors, with a window showing a bicycle parked outside, and the lighting is dim, creating a somewhat eerie atmosphere.
