1) In a well-lit indoor gym with white walls and visible pipes, a man in dark shorts and no shirt is attempting to lift a barbell loaded with green weight plates. 
2) The environment appears to be a training facility, possibly for powerlifting or Olympic weightlifting given the setup, and there are other individuals present, observing the lifter.
3) As he lifts the barbell from the ground to his chest, he struggles under its weight, which causes him to eventually drop it to the ground.
