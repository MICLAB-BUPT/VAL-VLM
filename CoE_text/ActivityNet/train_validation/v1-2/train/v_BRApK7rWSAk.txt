1) The video begins with a close-up shot of a green and yellow packet labeled 'No Fun' lying on the ground, which is then shown to be in an environment prepared for a fire, as evidenced by a pile of twigs and branches nearby.
2) A hand holding a black object, identified as a lighter, appears in the frame, indicating the intention to start a fire, and this causes the hand to move towards the packet.
3) The hand ignites the crumpled packet using the lighter, leading to flames becoming visible around it.
4) Following the ignition, the hand places the twigs and branches over the burning packet, which results in the creation of a makeshift fire.
5) The action of adding the twigs and branches to the burning packet causes the fire to fully establish, with flames and smoke rising from the burning materials.
