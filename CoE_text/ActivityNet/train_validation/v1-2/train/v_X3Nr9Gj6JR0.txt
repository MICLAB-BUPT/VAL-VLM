1) The video showcases the process of making fresh pasta from scratch, which starts with a person mixing flour and eggs in a bowl.
2) This mixture is then blended into a dough, either by hand or using a stand mixer, causing the ingredients to thoroughly combine.
3) The resulting dough is kneaded, either by hand or machine, leading to a smooth and elastic texture, which is then wrapped in plastic wrap and left to rest, allowing the gluten in the dough to relax.
4) After resting, the dough is divided into smaller portions, making it easier to handle and ensuring uniform thickness when rolled out.
5) Each portion is rolled out flat, first by hand and then fed through a pasta machine, which further flattens the dough, creating thin sheets or noodle-like strands.
6) The flattened sheets or strands are processed further; if they are sheets, they are laid flat, flipped over every 5 minutes, and dusted with flour to prevent sticking. If they are strands, they are directly cut into desired shapes.
7) The shaped pasta, whether in the form of sheets that have been cut or strands, is placed into a container for storage, indicating the completion of the pasta-making process.
8) Finally, the freshly made pasta, in some cases, is shown hanging, ready for cooking, showcasing the end product of the entire process.
