1) The video begins with a man in a Superman costume standing on a road, looking around, which causes him to be joined by other men in similar costumes.
2) They walk together down the sidewalk, leading them to board a red double-decker bus and sit inside, where one of them reads a newspaper.
3) This scene shifts to a laundromat, causing three men in Superman costumes to be sitting on washing machines, reading newspapers.
4) A man in a dark jacket approaches them, resulting in all of them standing up.
5) The scene transitions to a park, where the men are digging a hole next to a 'ROAD WORKS' sign while conversing, which leads to the man in the dark jacket approaching them again and engaging in a conversation.
6) The interaction then causes the man in the dark jacket to work on a bicycle wheel, inflating it and making adjustments, as the men in Superman costumes watch him.
7) After finishing, the man in the dark jacket hands the bicycle to one of the men in the Superman costume, who takes it and starts walking away, and the man in the dark jacket walks down a path in the park, carrying a briefcase.
8) Finally, the scene shifts to a man in a plaid suit sitting at a table outdoors, speaking into a microphone, becoming increasingly agitated, throwing papers, and eventually standing up from his chair, which leads to the conclusion of the video with a title card for Monty Python's YouTube channel, followed by an image of a foot and the text "http://www.youtube.com/MontyPython."
