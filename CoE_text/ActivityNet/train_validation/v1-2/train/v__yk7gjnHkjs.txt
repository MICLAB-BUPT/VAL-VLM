1) The video showcases a man practicing hammer throw in an outdoor setting, wearing a black tank top, shorts, and red shoes, which causes him to be easily identifiable.
2) The man starts by swinging the hammer around his body, building momentum with each rotation, which leads to him spinning multiple times before releasing the hammer into the air.
3) After the first man completes his throw, he walks out of the throwing area, causing the scene to transition to another athlete.
4) This next athlete, who is wearing a white shirt and black pants, also performs a hammer throw, which results in him following the same sequence of swinging, spinning, and releasing the hammer.
