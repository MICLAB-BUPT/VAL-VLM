1) The video showcases a woman in an outdoor setting, dressed in a white and red sports uniform with the UK flag design, holding a black compound bow and demonstrating archery techniques, which causes her to be the main focus of the instructional content.
2) She explains the proper form for drawing the bowstring back, aiming at a target board numbered '1', and demonstrates how to hold the bow, the correct stance, and the technique for releasing the arrow, which leads to close-up shots showing her hands adjusting the bowstring and nocking the arrow.
