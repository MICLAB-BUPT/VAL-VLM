1) The person decides to bathe the large black dog, possibly a Rottweiler or similar breed, in the backyard, causing them to bring the necessary items like soap and a hose.
2) The dog, wearing a chain collar, stands on the grass patiently, which allows the person to start the bathing process by spraying water and soap onto its fur using the hose.
3) After applying soap and water, the person uses their hands to lather and scrub the dog's back, ensuring thorough cleaning, which results in the dog being covered in soap suds.
