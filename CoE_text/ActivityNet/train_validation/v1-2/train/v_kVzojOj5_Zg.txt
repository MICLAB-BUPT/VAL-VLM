1) The video features a male instructor in a gymnasium, wearing a dark polo shirt and shorts, demonstrating volleyball techniques, which causes him to stand on the court with a net behind him, holding a volleyball.
2) The gym setting, characterized by wooden floors, blue walls, banners, and bright lighting, provides a suitable environment for the demonstration, which leads to the instructor being able to clearly show and explain the serve technique.
3) To demonstrate the serve, the instructor tosses the ball into the air and hits it over the net, after which he returns to his starting position, explaining the technique while gesturing with his hands, thereby emphasizing key points of the serve.
4) The presence of a black Molten ball cart (or bag) beside him suggests that there are multiple balls available for practice, which allows for continuous or repeated demonstrations if needed.
