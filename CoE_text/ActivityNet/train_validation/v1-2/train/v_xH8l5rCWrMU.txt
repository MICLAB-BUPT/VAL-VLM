1) The video starts with a woman, Deb, standing in a kitchen, wearing an apron and speaking to the camera, which causes the scene to transition to a close-up of a bowl of pasta salad on a wooden table.
2) Various ingredients are displayed: pasta, zucchini, mushrooms, spring onions, tomatoes, basil, parsley, extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan cheese, which leads to Deb chopping vegetables like tomatoes and zucchini on a wooden cutting board.
3) After chopping the vegetables, Deb adds these vegetables to a pan with onions and mushrooms, sautéing them together, which results in her then cooking the pasta in boiling water.
4) Once the pasta is cooked, she mixes it with the sautéed vegetables and stirs it, adding some liquid (presumably the extra virgin olive oil) and grated Parmesan cheese for flavor, which allows her to plate the pasta salad.
5) Finally, she serves the pasta in a white bowl, garnishing it with fresh herbs and additional grated cheese, completing the dish.
