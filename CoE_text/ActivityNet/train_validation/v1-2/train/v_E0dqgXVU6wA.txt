1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'cutepolish nail tutorial' in white, which then transitions to show a hand with nails painted in blue, featuring rainbow stripes and a cat design.
2) The tutorial starts with painting a white base on a nail, which causes the subsequent colors and designs to stand out more vividly.
3) After the base is applied, horizontal stripes of red, yellow, green, and blue are added, causing the nail to have a vibrant, rainbow effect.
4) A small piece of paper is used as a stencil for the cat design, which leads to the creation of an outline for the cat, making it easier to fill in with colors.
5) The cat is then painted using brown, gray, and pink colors, leading to the formation of its body and face.
6) The use of a fine brush to add black eyes and a nose, and to paint the ears, results in the cat design becoming more detailed and lifelike.
7) The use of a small tool to refine the edges and add intricate details to the cat's face and body enhances the overall appearance of the nail art, contributing to a polished finish.
8) Finally, the completed nail art, showcasing the cat design on a blue background with rainbow stripes, is displayed, marking the end of the tutorial.
