1) A young boy in pajamas is brushing his teeth in a bathroom, standing in front of a sink with a mirror above it.
2) The bathroom has red walls with a floral pattern, a white door, and various toiletries on the counter, including a soap dispenser, toothpaste, and a cup.
3) There are two towels hanging on a rack behind him, which causes the setting to be fully equipped for the boy's morning or night routine.
4) The boy is holding a toothbrush and looking at himself in the mirror while brushing his teeth, causing him to ensure he is cleaning his teeth properly.
5) After brushing, the action of rinsing his mouth with water from the cup and spitting it into the sink follows, as part of the dental hygiene process.
6) The completion of rinsing his mouth then causes him to turn off the faucet, signifying the end of using water.
7) Finally, the boy dries his hands with a towel, an action caused by the need to clean and dry his hands after washing.
