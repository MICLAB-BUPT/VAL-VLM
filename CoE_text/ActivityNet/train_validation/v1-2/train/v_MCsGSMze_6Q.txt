1) The video begins with a title screen displaying "Richard Nixon: Piano Concerto #1 1961," which causes the viewer to anticipate a performance or presentation involving Richard Nixon and piano music.
2) It then transitions to two men in suits sitting on chairs, engaged in conversation, where one of them (presumably Nixon) is gesturing while speaking, indicating that he is actively participating in a dialogue or giving a speech.
3) They both stand up and walk towards a piano, an action caused by the conclusion or pause of their discussion, and one of them sits down to play, suggesting that the previous conversation was related to or leading up to this musical performance.
4) The camera focuses on his hands as he plays the piano, showcasing his skill and technique, which is a direct result of him sitting at the piano and beginning to play.
5) After playing, he stands up and walks away from the piano, waving to an audience that is clapping and cheering, an action caused by the completion of his performance and the positive reception from the audience.
6) He shakes hands with another man who approaches him, and they exchange a few words, a gesture caused by the mutual respect and acknowledgment of the performance, before the video ends.
