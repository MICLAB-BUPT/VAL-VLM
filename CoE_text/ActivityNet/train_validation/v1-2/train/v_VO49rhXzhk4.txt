1) The woman in a green jacket begins the gift-wrapping process by placing the book on a white sheet of paper, which serves as the initial step to protect and prepare the book for wrapping.
2) After laying the book down, she then wraps it with tissue paper and secures it with tape, causing the book to be initially protected and ready for the next layer.
3) Following the tissue paper, she covers the wrapped book with blue wrapping paper, folding and creasing it neatly, which enhances the appearance and presentation of the gift.
4) Finally, she adds a green ribbon to the package, tying it around the wrapped book, thus completing the gift-wrapping process and presenting it as a finished, aesthetically pleasing gift.
