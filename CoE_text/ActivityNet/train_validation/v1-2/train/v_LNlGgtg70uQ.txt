1) The woman starts by pouring vodka into a shaker, which causes the base of the cocktail to be established.
2) She then adds grenadine and lemon juice to the shaker, which causes the mixture to have a sweet and sour flavor profile.
3) After adding these ingredients, she shakes the mixture vigorously, which causes the ingredients to mix thoroughly and chill.
4) Once the drink is mixed, she strains it into a martini glass, which causes the cocktail to be served in an appropriate and elegant vessel.
5) Finally, she garnishes the drink with an orange slice (or peel), which causes the cocktail to have an enhanced visual appeal and a complementary aroma.
