1) The person starts by applying the base coat on their nails, which is the first step in preparing the nail surface for the color and ensuring it adheres properly.
2) After the base coat, they add a second layer of dark red or burgundy polish to achieve more coverage, causing the color to become more vibrant and uniform.
3) In one scenario, after the two layers, the person uses a thin brush to create intricate designs on each nail, resulting in an elegant and sophisticated look with added personalization and detail.
4) In another scenario, instead of adding designs, the person applies a clear top coat over the entire nail, which seals in the color and adds a glossy finish, causing the manicure to be more durable and long-lasting.
