5) His movements are fluid and controlled, demonstrating experience and skill in the sport, which leads to a successful and strong throw when he releases the discus.
6) In the background, there are other athletes and spectators observing the practice session, indicating that this might be a practice session or a competition, which suggests that the environment is an outdoor sports facility with clear skies and ample sunlight.
