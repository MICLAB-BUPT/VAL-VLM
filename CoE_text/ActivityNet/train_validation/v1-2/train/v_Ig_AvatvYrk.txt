1) The video showcases a person demonstrating how to style hair using various tools and products, which causes the individual to start by holding a spray bottle and combing their hair.
2) This initial preparation of the hair leads to the use of electric clippers to trim the sides of their head, ensuring an even cut, which then causes the person to use scissors for more precise trimming, especially around the ears and neck, and on the top of the hair to achieve a desired look.
3) After the trimming with both clippers and scissors is complete, this action leads to the application of a product from a container labeled 'Hanz de Fukur' to their hair, causing the person to rub it through their hair to add texture and hold.
4) The application of the hair product results in the person styling their hair using their hands, creating a neat and polished appearance, while they occasionally look into a mirror to check their progress.
