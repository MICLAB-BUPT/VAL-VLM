1) The person is lying down on a chair with their head tilted back in a piercing studio, indicating they are prepared for the ear piercing process.
2) The piercer, wearing gloves and using a clamp to hold the earlobe in place, uses a needle to pierce the person's earlobe, causing the actual piercing to occur.
3) After the initial piercing, the piercer, still wearing gloves, uses forceps to hold the earlobe steady, which allows for the precise insertion of a piece of jewelry into the newly created hole.
4) The entire process is carried out with precision and care by the piercer, ensuring that the jewelry is properly placed and secured, which results in a completed and safe ear piercing.
