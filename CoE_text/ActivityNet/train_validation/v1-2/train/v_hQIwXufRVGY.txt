1) A person wearing blue jeans and brown shoes is seen walking on the sidewalk, holding a leash attached to a black dog, guiding it along the path.
2) The black dog, being larger, leads the way, with a white dog following closely behind, both walking on a paved surface, possibly a sidewalk or street.
3) The black dog occasionally looks back at the white dog, ensuring it stays close, which causes the white dog to follow its lead attentively.
4) At one point, the black dog stops, causing the white dog to also stop, creating a brief pause in their walk.
