1) A bald man in a white t-shirt is standing in front of a bathroom mirror, holding an electric shaver.
2) The presence of the electric shaver in his hand causes him to appear as if he is demonstrating how to use it.
3) As part of the demonstration, he gestures with his hands and occasionally touches his face as if shaving, which further illustrates the use of the shaver.
4) The setting, including a shower curtain with a floral pattern, a towel hanging on the wall, and a wooden cabinet, along with bright lighting, likely from ceiling lights, provides a typical bathroom background for the demonstration.
