1) The man, wearing a black sleeveless top and dark pants with yellow stripes, is practicing discus throwing in an outdoor sports field.
2) He starts by holding the discus in his right hand, then spins around multiple times to gain momentum, which causes him to release the discus into the air.
3) The athlete is inside a netted area, likely for safety, with bags of sand or similar material piled around the perimeter, which is designed to prevent any potential accidents from affecting the surroundings.
4) As the athlete spins to throw the discus, he loses balance, which causes him to fall onto his backside and slide on the ground.
