1) The video starts with a woman in a white lab coat standing in front of a sink, talking and gesturing.
2) She then turns on the faucet and washes her hands thoroughly under running water, which causes the scene to transition to a close-up of her hands.
3) In the close-up, she applies soap from a dispenser and lathers it well between her fingers and palms, ensuring all areas are covered with soap.
4) After lathering, she rinses off the soap under the running water, making sure to clean all surfaces, which leads to the next step.
5) She dries her hands using a paper towel, emphasizing the importance of drying hands completely to avoid recontamination, and uses the paper towel to turn off the faucet.
6) Throughout the video, there are text overlays providing tips such as 'Wash your hands like a doctor!' and 'Step 1: Run warm water.'
7) The background remains consistent with a light-colored wall and a stainless steel sink, setting the environment for the demonstration.
