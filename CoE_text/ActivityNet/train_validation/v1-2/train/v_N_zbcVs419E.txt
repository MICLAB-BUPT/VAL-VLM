1) The video begins with a hand sketching an eagle's head, which then leads to painting a blue car and a black vase with a feather inside.
2) After the vase, the artist uses a dropper to create a feather silhouette on white paper, followed by a tree silhouette on yellow paper, causing a transition into more detailed artistic work.
3) The creation of red flowers with green stems and leaves on white paper, adding depth and texture, follows, which is a common element in both sequences, indicating a shared focus on nature and color.
4) A hummingbird is sketched and filled in with blue and green hues, leading to the next step where the artist creates a rooster silhouette using blue ink, blending it with a tissue for texture, showcasing the versatility of the artist's techniques.
5) Finally, drawing a green apple with a silver leaf and a blue butterfly on white paper completes the sequence, summarizing the artist's range from realistic sketches to abstract silhouettes.
