1) The man starts by touching and examining his beard, which causes him to identify the areas that need grooming.
2) He then uses a comb to style his beard, which prepares it for trimming and helps him visualize the final shape.
3) After styling, he trims his beard with an electric razor, which causes the beard to become more even and neat in appearance.
4) He applies shaving cream to his face, which softens the hair and provides a smooth surface for shaving, leading to a closer and more comfortable shave.
5) Using a straight razor, he shaves off any remaining hair, which results in a clean and well-groomed look.
6) Finally, he rinses his face and dries it with a towel, which removes any excess shaving cream and water, completing the grooming process.
