1) A person in a black jacket and hat is grooming a brown horse with a brush, which causes the horse to stand still while being groomed.
2) The environment appears to be a rural setting, possibly a farm, with a red trailer and some trees visible in the background. It's daytime, and the lighting suggests it might be overcast. The ground is muddy, indicating recent rain or melting snow, which provides the setting for the grooming activity.
3) A child in an orange jacket enters the scene, observing the grooming process, which leads to the child attempting to help by holding the horse's tail.
4) The interaction between the person and the child seems cooperative and educational, as if teaching the child about horse care, which results in the person in the orange jacket then taking over the grooming task from the first person.
