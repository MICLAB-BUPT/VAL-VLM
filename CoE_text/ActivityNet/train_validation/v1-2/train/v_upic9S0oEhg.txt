1) The video features a band performing in an intimate setting, likely a small venue or studio, which causes the environment to have warm lighting with a yellowish hue, creating a cozy atmosphere.
2) The band consists of three members: a guitarist on the left, a bassist in the center, and a drummer partially visible behind them, and this setup leads to close-up shots of the musicians, focusing on their instruments and movements as they play.
3) The bassist, dressed in a white t-shirt and dark pants, is particularly highlighted in the video, showcasing his technique and engagement with the music, which indicates that he is standing in front of a microphone and playing an acoustic guitar in a dimly lit room.
4) The presence of other musical instruments around the room, including a bass guitar and a drum set, suggests that the video also includes a man, who has a beard, playing an acoustic guitar, thereby integrating the two scenarios into one cohesive performance.
