1) The woman begins by applying a white cream from a tube onto her face, spreading it evenly across her cheeks, forehead, and chin using her fingers, which causes the skin to be prepped for the next steps.
2) After ensuring the cream is fully absorbed, she uses a towel to gently pat her face dry, which prepares the skin for the application of the subsequent products.
3) She then applies a second product, a clear gel-like substance, to her face, focusing on her cheeks and forehead, which acts as a primer or foundation, further preparing the skin for makeup.
4) Finally, she applies a third product, a small bottle of liquid, to her face, concentrating on her cheeks and forehead again, which is likely a moisturizer or sunscreen, completing the skincare routine.
