1) The video begins with a man standing in front of a green screen, holding a squeegee and a cloth, which causes him to start cleaning the glass surface with the squeegee.
2) After moving the squeegee from top to bottom, the man uses the cloth to wipe away any remaining water or soap residue, causing the glass to become cleaner.
3) The man repeats this process several times, ensuring that the glass is clean and streak-free, which demonstrates the proper technique for cleaning glass surfaces.
4) In another scene, the same man, now wearing a blue shirt, holds a white object, which appears to be a piece of paper or a card, causing him to look at the camera and talk while demonstrating something by moving the object around.
5) He then puts the white object down and picks up a tool or a device, which causes him to start using it on the previous object, as if he is fixing or adjusting it.
6) The man continues to work on the object, making adjustments, which suggests that he is demonstrating how to use the tool.
