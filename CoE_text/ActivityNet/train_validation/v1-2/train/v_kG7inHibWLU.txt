3) After their interaction, the first girl exits through the door, leading to the scene shifting to a different girl in a white dress entering the kitchen.
4) This new girl opens a drawer and moves towards the sink area, where she interacts with items on the counter, and then walks away.
5) A woman in a purple dress enters the kitchen, approaches the door, and appears to be looking for something or someone, which causes her to sit down on the floor, leaning against the door, appearing distressed or contemplative.
6) Finally, two girls, one in a pink dress and the other in a purple dress, enter the kitchen together, waving at the camera, and exit again.
