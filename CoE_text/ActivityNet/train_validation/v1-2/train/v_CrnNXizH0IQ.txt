1) The video features a man in a workshop setting, wearing a white polo shirt with 'Marvin' printed on it and blue jeans. He is working on a wooden box placed on a workbench cluttered with various tools like a red sander, a chisel, and other woodworking implements.
2) The man demonstrates the use of a hand plane on the wooden box, explaining its function and how to use it effectively, which causes him to then use a round sanding tool to smooth the edges of the box, showcasing the technique and precision required for this task.
3) After using the hand plane, he proceeds to demonstrate how to use a sander on the wooden box, starting by showing the box and then carefully sanding the edges and surfaces of the box with a handheld electric sander, ensuring that all areas are evenly sanded.
4) Throughout the process, he handles different tools, including a chisel and a small brush, to clean or refine the wood, and after sanding, he inspects the box to check for any imperfections or rough spots.
