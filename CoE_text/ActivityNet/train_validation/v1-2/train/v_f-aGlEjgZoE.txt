1) The video starts with a close-up of an eye, already featuring bold eyeliner and mascara, setting the stage for a makeup tutorial.
2) The scene transitions to a woman in front of a patterned background, holding up a tube of liquid eyeliner and a clear plastic strip, indicating she will demonstrate how to achieve the look.
3) She places the strip on her eyelid, aligning it with the outer corner of her eye, to use as a guide, which causes the eyeliner application to be more precise and symmetrical.
4) Using a black eyeliner pencil, she carefully traces along the strip, ensuring the line is neat and well-defined, which results in a clean and professional-looking winged eyeliner.
5) After applying the eyeliner, she removes the strip, revealing a sharp, clean line, showing the effectiveness of using the strip as a stencil.
6) She then applies mascara and false eyelashes, enhancing the overall eye makeup, which contributes to the dramatic and completed makeup look.
7) The video concludes with a screen displaying social media handles and a message thanking viewers, encouraging them to follow and perhaps try the technique themselves.
