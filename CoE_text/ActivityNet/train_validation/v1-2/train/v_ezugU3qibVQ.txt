1) The video begins with a woman in a green top and necklace, standing against a striped background.
2) She is seen talking to the camera, which causes her to hold up a hair styling tool package labeled 'Waring' with various colored rollers inside.
3) Holding up the package of hair rollers leads her to demonstrate how to use the hair roller by placing it on her head and rolling sections of her hair around it.
4) Demonstrating the usage of the hair rollers causes her to secure them in place and wait for the style to set.
5) After the style has set, she removes the rollers, leading to the revelation of her hair curled with the rollers.
6) Revealing the final styled look causes her to smile and speak directly to the viewers, concluding the demonstration.
