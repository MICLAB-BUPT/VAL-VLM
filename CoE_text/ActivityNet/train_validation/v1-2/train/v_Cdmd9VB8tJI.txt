1) The person in a floral shirt and straw hat is bathing a brown dog with white markings on its face and chest outdoors, which is caused by the need to clean the dog.
2) They use a hose to wet the dog, which causes the dog's fur to become sufficiently soaked for the application of shampoo.
3) After wetting the dog, the person applies shampoo from a bottle labeled 'Shampoo' onto the dog's fur, causing the start of the cleaning process.
4) The person lathers the shampoo thoroughly and ensures it is spread evenly by scrubbing the dog's back with their hands, which causes the dog to be cleaned properly.
5) The environment, a well-maintained garden or backyard with vibrant greenery and purple flowers, provides a suitable and pleasant setting for this activity, contributing to the calm and cooperative demeanor of the dog.
