1) The man is in a forest setting, preparing to start a fire, which causes him to kneel on the ground next to a pile of sticks and twigs.
2) He carefully places smaller pieces of wood inside a circular metal container, ensuring they are positioned correctly for ignition, which leads to the use of a lighter to ignite the fire.
3) After igniting the fire with the lighter, he adds more wood to sustain the fire, causing the flames to grow.
4) The man's focus and determination in building the fire contribute to the successful creation and maintenance of the campfire.
