1) The woman, with curly hair and wearing a black top and gold jewelry, is seated in an indoor setting, likely her home office or bedroom, which causes the background to include a computer monitor, a door, and various items on a desk.
2) The natural lighting, possibly from a window out of frame, casts soft shadows on her face, which contributes to the casual, personal vlog-style atmosphere of the video.
3) As she engages directly with the camera, speaking and gesturing with her hands to emphasize her points, it leads to her adjusting her hair, touching her necklace, and moving her hands expressively as she speaks.
4) Her changing expressions while talking indicate a conversational tone, which results in the overall impression that she is sharing information or opinions with her audience.
