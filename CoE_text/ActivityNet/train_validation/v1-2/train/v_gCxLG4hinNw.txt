2) The man's performance, as he is standing in front of a microphone and moving his fingers on the instrument's chanter to create music, causes the audience to clap and cheer.
3) A woman in a red jacket is seated on a couch next to the bagpipe player, and a man in a gold jacket and brown pants stands nearby, watching the performance, indicating that there are two people observing the performance.
4) After the man finishes his performance, the positive reaction from the audience, along with the completion of the musical act, causes the man in the gold jacket to shake hands with the bagpipe player, leading to both of them smiling at each other.
