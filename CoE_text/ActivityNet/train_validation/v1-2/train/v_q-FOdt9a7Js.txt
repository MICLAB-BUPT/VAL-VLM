1) The person, dressed in a black coat and white hood (or hat), is shoveling snow from a sidewalk using a manual snow shovel with large wheels, which causes the path to be cleared.
2) The action of pushing the shovel forward to scoop up snow, then lifting and throwing it off the sidewalk, leads to the removal of snow from the walkway.
3) The ongoing snowfall throughout the video results in a continuous accumulation of snow on the ground, necessitating the person's continued effort in shoveling.
4) The presence of snow-covered trees, houses, and tire tracks in the background indicates that the environment is experiencing a snowy weather condition, which is the reason for the person's activity.
