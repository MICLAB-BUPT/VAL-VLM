1) The video showcases a man in a kilt participating in a throwing event, where he is seen standing on a concrete platform.
2) He holds an object (a hammer in the first answer and a heavy ball attached to a handle in the second) with both hands, causing him to start swinging it around his body or back and forth to gain momentum.
3) As he builds up force by increasing the speed and momentum of the swing, this causes him to bend his knees and lean forward, preparing for the release.
4) Finally, the preparation and momentum cause him to release the object, sending it flying through the air.
