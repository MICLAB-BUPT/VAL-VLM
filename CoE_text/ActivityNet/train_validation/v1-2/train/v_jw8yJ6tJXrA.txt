1) The video captures a long jump event at an outdoor track and field facility, specifically at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, causing the setting to be a sunny day with clear skies, and the sun is low on the horizon, indicating either early morning or late afternoon.
2) A male athlete in black sportswear prepares for his jump, which causes him to run down the track towards the sandpit, with spectators and officials visible around the pit area, some seated under a canopy while others stand or walk by.
3) The camera angle provides a low perspective, capturing the athlete's movement from behind as he approaches and takes off for the jump, which leads to the athlete taking off from the board, soaring through the air before landing smoothly in the sand.
