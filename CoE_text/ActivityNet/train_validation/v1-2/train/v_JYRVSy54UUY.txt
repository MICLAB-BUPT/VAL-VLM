1) The woman standing in front of a black background with small white lights, holding a red accordion, causes the setting to be visually focused on her and the instrument.
2) The fact that she is wearing a gray shirt and has dark hair tied back, along with the presence of two other accordions (one black and one silver) on either side of her, contributes to the professional and organized appearance of the demonstration.
3) Her movement of hands across the keys and buttons, combined with the video focusing on her upper body and the accordion, including occasional close-up shots of her hands and the instrument, causes the viewer to clearly see and understand the techniques involved.
4) The woman's actions of holding and playing the instrument, along with the close-up shots, are intended to explain the techniques involved in playing the accordion, which results in providing instructional content for viewers interested in learning this musical instrument.
