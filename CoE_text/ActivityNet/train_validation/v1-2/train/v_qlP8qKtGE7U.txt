1) A baby wearing a bib is sitting in a high chair and playing with a glass of chocolate milk, holding a fork in one hand and the glass in the other.
2) The baby is trying to drink the chocolate milk but is having difficulty because the glass is too tall, causing the baby to look for alternative ways to consume the drink.
3) An adult's hand is seen holding the glass steady, which allows the baby to attempt to drink from it using the fork.
4) The baby repeatedly dips the fork into the glass and brings it towards their mouth, trying to scoop up some of the chocolate milk, as an exploration of different methods to interact with the drink.
5) The baby is also trying to use the fork to stir the chocolate milk, but is not very successful, indicating that the primary focus is on consuming rather than mixing the drink.
6) Throughout the interaction, the baby's actions are curious and playful, showing a desire to learn and experiment, and the baby is looking at the camera and smiling, suggesting enjoyment in the process.
