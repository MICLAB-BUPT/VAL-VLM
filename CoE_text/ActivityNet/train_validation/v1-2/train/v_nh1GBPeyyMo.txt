1) The video begins with a person wrapping a white box in red paper, which is done to prepare the gift.
2) They measure, cut, and fold the paper around the box, securing it with tape, to ensure the gift is neatly wrapped.
3) Next, they wrap a gold ribbon around the box, tying it into a bow on top, to add an aesthetic touch and secure the wrapping.
4) The person uses scissors to trim the ends of the ribbon, ensuring the presentation is tidy and visually appealing.
5) They add a tag to the present, likely to identify the recipient or include a message.
6) Finally, the wrapped gift is placed on a table next to a pair of scissors and some red paper, completing the gift-wrapping process.
