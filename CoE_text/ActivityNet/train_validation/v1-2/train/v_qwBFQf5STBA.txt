1) The video begins with a close-up of a hand with nails, setting the stage for the nail art process.
2) A base coat is applied, which causes the surface to be prepared for the subsequent layers of polish.
3) The person then uses a sponge to dab on different colors, creating a rainbow gradient effect on the nails.
4) After the gradient is established, the application of a coat of glittery polish adds an extra dimension and sparkle to the design, enhancing its visual appeal.
5) Using a fine brush, black zebra stripes are painted over the rainbow gradient, causing the creation of a unique and intricate zebra print pattern.
6) Finally, a clear top coat is applied, sealing the design and adding a glossy finish, thus completing the vibrant and detailed nail art.
