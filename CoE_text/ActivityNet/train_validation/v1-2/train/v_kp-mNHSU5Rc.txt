1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'Heiniger quality + swiss made' and 'COXHAMS FARM' on a brick wall, which then transitions to a stable where a brown horse is seen from the side, looking out of its stall.
2) A woman in a purple jacket leads the horse outside, passing by green pillars and potted plants, causing her to prepare for the grooming process.
3) She opens a black case labeled 'PROGRESSO' containing grooming tools and applies oil to a black electric clipper, which she will use to groom the horse.
4) The woman uses the clipper to groom the horse's coat, starting with the neck area, leading to close-up shots showing the clipper removing hair and revealing the horse's skin underneath.
5) She continues grooming, ensuring an even coat, and after completing the clipping, she cleans the clipper with a brush, indicating the end of the clipping phase.
6) The woman then brushes the horse's coat to remove any loose hair, ensuring the horse is well-groomed.
7) Finally, she leads the horse back into the stable, closing the door behind them, which causes the completion of the grooming process.
