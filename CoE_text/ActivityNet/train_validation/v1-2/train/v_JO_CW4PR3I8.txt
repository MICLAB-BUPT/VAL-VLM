1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'artofmanliness.com', which causes it to transition to a man in a white shirt and dark pants standing against a beige wall, holding a wooden shoe stretcher.
2) Holding the stretcher leads the man to demonstrate how to use it by first explaining its features.
3) After the explanation, he places his foot into the stretcher, causing him to then use the attached cloth to pull the shoe tight.
4) Pulling the shoe tight results in the man adjusting the straps or cloth around his shoe, ensuring a snug fit.
5) Ensuring a snug fit prompts the man to continue adjusting the straps or cloth and the stretcher to make sure the shoe is properly stretched.
6) Once the demonstration is complete, this causes the video to end with another black screen displaying the text 'artofmanliness.com'.
