1) The video shows a woman ironing a pair of khaki pants on an ironing board.
2) She starts by laying the pants flat and smoothing them out with her hands, which causes the fabric to be prepared for ironing.
3) Then, she uses an iron to press the fabric, moving it back and forth along the length of the pants, causing the wrinkles to be removed.
4) She carefully irons each section, ensuring that all creases are smoothed out, which results in a neat appearance of the pants.
5) After ironing one side, she flips the pants over and irons the other side, leading to both sides being wrinkle-free.
6) Finally, she lifts the pants off the ironing board and inspects them for any remaining wrinkles, which ensures the completion of the ironing process.
