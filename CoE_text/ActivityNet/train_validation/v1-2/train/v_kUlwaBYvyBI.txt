1) A man in a workshop is demonstrating the process of refinishing wood, which causes him to start by showing a piece of wood and explaining its condition and the need for refinishing.
2) The explanation of the wood's condition leads to the use of a sanding block to smooth the wood's surface, with an emphasis on removing imperfections.
3) After smoothing the wood, he applies a liquid finish (a dark stain) with a cloth, ensuring even coverage, which is aimed at enhancing the appearance of the wood.
4) The application of the liquid finish then necessitates another round of sanding, this time with a different tool, likely to further refine the surface and prepare it for the final steps.
5) Finally, the desire for a finer finish prompts the use of an electric sander, highlighting the difference between manual and electric sanding techniques, and leading to a more polished result.
6) Throughout the process, the environment remains cluttered with woodworking tools and materials, indicating an active workspace, and the lighting stays bright, illuminating the work area clearly, which supports the detailed and deliberate actions of the man.
