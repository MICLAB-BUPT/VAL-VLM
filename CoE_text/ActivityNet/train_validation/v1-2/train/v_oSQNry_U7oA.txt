1) The man, wearing a yellow and black wetsuit, begins to interact with the walrus by petting it.
2) The walrus responds to the petting by shaking its head vigorously, which causes the man to attempt to feed it a piece of food.
3) The walrus shakes its head again, refusing the food, leading the man to continue trying to feed it, but the walrus remains unresponsive.
4) Frustrated by the lack of response, the man then tries to play a saxophone for the walrus, in an effort to engage it differently.
5) Despite the man's attempts to play the saxophone, the walrus continues to shake its head and refuse the food, indicating disinterest or dissatisfaction.
6) Eventually, the man gives up on his attempts to feed or play with the walrus, due to the persistent refusal and lack of engagement from the animal.
