1) The video shows a person's hands preparing a fruit salad in a kitchen, which causes the person to start peeling and cutting various fruits, including bananas, apples, and oranges, on a black tray.
2) After ensuring that the skins and seeds are removed from the fruits, the person then begins to peel and cut walnuts on the same black tray, using a knife to cut the walnuts into halves and their hands to peel off the outer shell of the walnut halves.
3) The peeled walnuts are placed into a black bowl that already contains sliced bananas and oranges, causing the person to repeat the process multiple times, adding more walnuts to the bowl.
