1) The man starts washing the golden retriever dog in an outdoor area, using a hose to spray water on the dog.
2) The spraying of water causes the dog to get thoroughly wet, which is essential for a proper cleaning.
3) After ensuring the dog is wet, the man uses his hands to scrub and clean the dog's fur, focusing on different areas of its body.
4) The scrubbing action with his hands causes the dirt and any soap (if applied) to be removed from the dog's coat.
5) The man then rinses off the soap with the hose, making sure all soap is removed from the dog's coat, causing the dog to be fully cleaned.
6) Once the cleaning process is completed, the man guides the dog away from the washing area, allowing it to dry off naturally.
