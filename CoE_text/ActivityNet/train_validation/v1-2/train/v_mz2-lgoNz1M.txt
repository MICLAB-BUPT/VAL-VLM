1) The video begins with a man wearing a camouflage cap and white shirt, speaking to the camera in an indoor setting, which causes the scene to transition to a close-up of a tattoo stencil on paper.
2) The stencil features a design with the word 'DAD' and a winged figure, causing a person to be shown preparing for a tattoo session by cleaning their arm with a pink sponge and applying the stencil.
3) After the preparation, the tattoo artist, identified as Clint Randsell and wearing gloves, starts working on the tattoo using a tattoo machine, which leads to him carefully tracing the outline of the stencil on the client's skin.
4) As the tattooing process continues, the artist fills in the design with black ink, ensuring precision and detail, which then results in the artist wiping the freshly inked tattoo with a cloth.
5) The action of wiping the tattoo with a cloth reveals the completed design, thus concluding the video.
