1) The video features a man, identified as Lay from the band EXO, playing the piano in front of an audience, which causes the setting to be a stage with large windows showing a cityscape view.
2) Lay is dressed in a red shirt and black pants, standing behind a Kurzweil keyboard, which leads to close-up shots of his hands on the keys, emphasizing his finger movements.
3) The environment appears to be an indoor setting with natural light coming through windows, suggesting a daytime scene, and this, combined with the presence of a microphone stand, indicates that it is a performance or recording setup.
4) Two individuals are seen seated, one wearing a white top with a pattern and the other in a striped shirt, both attentively watching the pianist, which contributes to the overall atmosphere of a live performance or concert setting.
5) The room has a modern aesthetic with curtains, and the text overlays indicating the year 2012 and mentioning 'LAY' as the pianist cause the identification of the event as a special performance during his first solo fan meeting in China.
