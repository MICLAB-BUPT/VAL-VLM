1) The video starts with a title screen introducing 'Alberta Health and Wellness Presents' followed by the topic 'Hey Top Doc: What is the proper way to wash your hands?'.
2) This introduction causes the scene to transition to a bathroom where three men are present, setting the stage for the demonstration.
3) In the bathroom, one man in a light blue shirt and khaki pants is washing his hands at a sink, while another man in a black shirt stands nearby observing, which prepares the viewer for the upcoming detailed demonstration.
4) A third man in a dark shirt joins them, adding to the audience of the demonstration.
5) The presence of these men, especially the observer, leads to the man in the black shirt demonstrating how to properly wash hands using soap from a dispenser, rubbing his hands together under running water, ensuring all areas of his hands are cleaned, which is the core instructional content of the video.
6) After rinsing off the soap, he dries his hands with a paper towel, completing the handwashing process.
7) The thoroughness and clarity of this demonstration cause the man in the light blue shirt and khaki pants to also wash his hands, following the same procedure as the man in the black shirt, reinforcing the instructions given.
8) The video concludes with a closing message thanking viewers for watching and providing a website link for more information, caused by the completion of the demonstration and the need to offer further resources.
