1) The man in the workshop starts by applying a substance from a bottle onto the wooden board, which is the initial step to prepare the surface for finishing.
2) He then uses a cloth to spread the substance evenly across the board, ensuring that the entire surface is coated and ready for buffing, which is crucial for achieving a uniform finish.
3) After the application of the substance, he buffs the board with a white cloth, focusing on creating a smooth and shiny surface, which enhances the appearance and texture of the wood.
4) In another sequence, after applying the substance, the man sands the board with sandpaper to ensure an even surface, which is an alternative method to achieve smoothness before the final polishing.
5) Post-sanding, he wipes down the board with a cloth, possibly to remove any dust or residue, which is essential for a clean and polished look.
6) Finally, the man compares the finished board with an unfinished one, highlighting the difference in appearance. This comparison serves to demonstrate the effectiveness of his work and the transformation achieved through the application, buffing, and/or sanding process.
