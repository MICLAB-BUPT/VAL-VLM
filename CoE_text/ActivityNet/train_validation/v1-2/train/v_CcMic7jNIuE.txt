1) The man, dressed in a blue and white outfit, is in a gym setting with various equipment around.
2) He approaches the barbell, which is loaded with red and yellow weights, and bends down to grip it with both hands.
3) The act of gripping the barbell causes him to prepare for lifting it off the ground.
4) Lifting the barbell off the ground leads him to bring it up to his chest level while standing up straight.
5) After holding the barbell at chest level, he transitions into a squat position, still maintaining his hold on the barbell.
6) From the squat position, standing up straight again causes him to then push the barbell overhead, completing the lift.
7) Successfully finishing the lift causes him to drop the barbell onto the wooden floor and step back.
