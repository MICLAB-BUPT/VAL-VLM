1) The video begins with a girl in a room, talking to the camera.
2) She then moves to a carpeted floor where another person's hand is placed on a white paper towel, causing her to start applying nail polish to the other person's fingernails, carefully painting each nail.
3) After finishing one hand, she moves to the other hand and repeats the process, ensuring each nail is evenly coated.
4) Throughout the video, there are glimpses of various nail polish bottles around the workspace, which leads to the girl using different colors of nail polish.
5) The girl starts by applying a base coat, then adds various colors like red, blue, and purple, causing the nails to be painted in multiple hues.
6) After the polish dries, she uses scissors to trim the excess nail polish from around her cuticles, resulting in a neat and tidy finish.
