1) The video shows a group of kayakers on a river, with one person in a red kayak attempting to flip their kayak over, which causes the series of actions that follow.
2) The kayaker in the red kayak, who is wearing a black wetsuit and helmet, starts by paddling forward, then leans back and lifts the front of the kayak into the air, causing the kayak to become unstable.
3) As he continues to paddle and lean, he loses balance, which causes the kayak to flip over completely, submerging him underwater.
4) After resurfacing, the man begins to right the kayak, using his paddle for support, which allows him to regain control and stability.
