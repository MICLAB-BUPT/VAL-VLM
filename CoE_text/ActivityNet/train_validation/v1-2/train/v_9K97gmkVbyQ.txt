1) The video starts with a woman standing behind a table in a well-lit room filled with colorful wrapping paper and ribbons.
2) She begins by placing a green patterned gift bag on the table, followed by a white box, causing her to demonstrate how to pack the box into the gift bag, ensuring it fits properly.
3) After placing the white box, she then places the tissue paper inside the gift bag, smoothing it out to create a neat appearance, which leads to her tying an orange ribbon around the top of the gift bag, securing it neatly.
4) Having completed the first gift bag, she picks up another gift bag, this time red, and repeats the process of placing a white tissue paper inside and tying an orange ribbon around its handle, showcasing her expertise in gift-wrapping.
