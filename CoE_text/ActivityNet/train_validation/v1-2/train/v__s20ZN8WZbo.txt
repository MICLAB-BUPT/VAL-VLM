2) He starts by pouring ice into a glass, which is the first step in making the drink, as it cools down the ingredients and dilutes them slightly.
3) After adding the ice, he adds various liquids from different bottles, including a red liquid and a yellow liquid, to create the desired flavor profile of the cocktail.
