1) The video starts with a woman in an orange top standing behind a table with various cleaning supplies, including a bottle of vinegar, a spray bottle, and paper towels.
2) The presence of the cleaning supplies on the table causes her to begin demonstrating how to make a homemade window cleaner using these items.
3) She pours vinegar into the spray bottle, which is followed by adding water from a large jug, causing the creation of the cleaning solution.
4) Shaking the spray bottle to mix the ingredients thoroughly leads to the preparation of the homemade window cleaner.
5) The prepared solution being sprayed onto a window causes her to wipe it clean, initially mentioned as with a paper towel, but also noted as with a cloth, indicating the use of a cleaning tool to remove the solution and dirt from the window.
6) After completing the demonstration, the action of having cleaned the window successfully causes the woman to smile and look at the camera, signaling the end of the video.
