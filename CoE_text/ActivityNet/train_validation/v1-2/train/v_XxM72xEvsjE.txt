1) The man, wearing a black sleeveless shirt and jeans, and the young boy, dressed in a camouflage t-shirt and blue jeans, are in the backyard.
2) The presence of green grass, a chain-link fence, garden beds with plants, and natural daylight sets the scene for their activity.
3) They are using a red lawnmower with a large grass catcher, which is the tool they need for mowing the lawn.
4) The man, also wearing a baseball cap, is teaching the boy how to mow the lawn, causing them to push the lawnmower together across the yard.
5) As they walk and work, the guidance from the man causes the boy to learn the task.
6) Their enjoyment of the shared activity is evident as they both smile while moving towards a house with a white picket fence and a small shed in the background.
