1) A young girl with her hair tied up in a bun is sitting at a table, wearing a red hoodie.
2) She is holding a small white object in her hands and appears to be examining it closely, turning it around and looking at it from different angles, which causes her to become focused on the object.
3) The girl then starts to use a pencil to draw or write on the object, maintaining her concentration on the task.
