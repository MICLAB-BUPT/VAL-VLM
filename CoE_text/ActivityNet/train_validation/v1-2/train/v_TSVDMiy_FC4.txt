1) The video begins with a title screen introducing 'HOW TO SHINE SHOES' and transitions to a pair of black shoes on a wooden surface.
2) The first step, which is removing the laces, causes the person to then stuff the shoe with paper, ensuring it retains its shape during the cleaning process.
3) Stuffing the shoe with paper then allows for an effective cleaning with a dry brush and cloth, as the shoe's surface becomes more accessible and easier to work with.
4) After cleaning, applying shoe polish using a yellow cloth and black polish is done, which enhances the appearance of the leather, causing it to look shinier and well-maintained.
5) The application of polish leads to the next step, which is buffing with a horsehair brush, to evenly distribute the polish and bring out a high shine.
6) Wiping off excess polish with a dry cloth after buffing prevents the buildup of too much polish, ensuring that the shoes do not look overly coated or sticky.
7) Allowing the shoe to dry after wiping off the excess polish ensures that when a water-dampened cloth is used to apply polish in small circles, the moisture helps in achieving a deeper and more even shine.
8) Repeating the process around the entire shoe with a damp cloth contributes to a consistent finish across the shoe, enhancing its overall appearance.
9) Finally, tying the laces and displaying the polished shoes concludes the process, showcasing the end result of the meticulous cleaning and polishing.
