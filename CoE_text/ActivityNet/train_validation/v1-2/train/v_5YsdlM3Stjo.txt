1) The video begins with a brown horse standing in a stable, wearing a halter and lead rope.
2) A person enters the frame, causing them to start grooming the horse's side using a brush.
3) The horse remains calm and still throughout the grooming process, allowing the person to move to the other side of the horse and continue brushing its side.
4) After finishing the grooming, the person steps back, which causes the horse to lower its head towards the ground.
5) The person then walks away from the horse, leaving it standing alone in the stable, thus ending the video.
