1) The video features a woman in a black top standing behind a bar counter, surrounded by various bottles of alcohol.
2) She begins by pouring a clear liquid into a martini glass, which is the base for the cocktail she is preparing.
3) Next, she adds ice cubes to the glass and proceeds to pour a blue liquid from another bottle, followed by a white liquid from a different bottle, to add color and additional flavors to the drink.
4) The woman then transfers the mixture into a metal shaker and shakes it vigorously, causing the ingredients to mix thoroughly and chill.
5) After shaking, she pours the mixed and chilled cocktail back into the martini glass, creating a visually appealing layered effect due to the different colored liquids.
6) Finally, she garnishes the drink with a slice of lime on the rim of the glass, adding a finishing touch that enhances the presentation and potentially the taste of the cocktail.
7) Throughout the process, she interacts with the camera, possibly explaining the steps or providing commentary, which helps engage the viewer and provides insight into the cocktail-making process.
