1) The man, dressed in a blue shirt and black shorts, stands on a concrete platform in an open field, holding a discus in his right hand, which is the starting position for his throw.
2) To initiate the throwing process, he takes a few steps forward, causing him to build up initial momentum.
3) He then spins around, further causing the increase of his rotational speed and momentum.
4) As a result of spinning and the built-up momentum, he releases the discus with a powerful throw.
5) Consequently, the discus flies through the air and lands in the distance.
