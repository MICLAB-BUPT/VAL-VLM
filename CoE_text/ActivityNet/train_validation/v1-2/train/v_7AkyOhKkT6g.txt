1) The video showcases a woman demonstrating her hair care routine, starting with her hair in twists.
2) She uses pink clips to section off her hair into four parts, which causes the sections to be manageable for the application of products.
3) She applies a leave-in conditioner from a white bottle labeled 'ion' onto each section, causing the hair to become more hydrated and easier to manage.
4) Following this, she uses a yellow bottle of olive oil and a pink bottle of setting lotion on her hair, further conditioning and preparing the hair for styling.
5) She then attaches blue spiral curlers to each section of her hair, twisting her hair at the roots and inserting them into the curlers, ensuring they are securely placed. This action is aimed at creating defined curls.
6) After applying more product, she wraps her hair in the curlers and secures them with orange clips, which helps to maintain the shape and integrity of the curls throughout the night.
7) The next morning, she removes the curlers, revealing tightly coiled curls as a result of the overnight setting process.
8) Finally, she styles her hair into a bun using a black headscarf, showcasing the final look that was achieved through the meticulous steps of her hair care routine.
