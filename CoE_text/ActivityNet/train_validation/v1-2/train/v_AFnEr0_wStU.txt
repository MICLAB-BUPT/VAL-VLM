1) The person lies down with their eyes closed in the piercing studio.
2) The piercer, wearing gloves, cleanses the area around the nose with a cotton swab, which prepares the site for the piercing and minimizes the risk of infection.
3) The piercer inserts a needle through the nostril, causing a small hole to be made where the jewelry will be placed.
4) A small stud is attached to the needle and left in the newly created hole, serving as the jewelry for the piercing.
5) After the piercing is complete, the piercer cleans the area again, ensuring it remains clean and reducing the chance of post-piercing complications.
6) The person then sits up, revealing the new nose piercing, indicating the end of the procedure.
