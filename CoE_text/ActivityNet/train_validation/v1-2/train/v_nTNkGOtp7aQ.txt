1) The video shows a swimming pool with people around it, and a man is standing on the edge of the pool, which in more detail, is the edge of a diving board above the swimming pool, preparing to jump in.
2) He jumps off the diving board, performing a dive into the water, causing him to enter the clear and blue water of the pool.
3) After entering the water, he swims towards the edge, an action that the camera follows.
4) The presence of other people around the pool, some sitting on the steps and others standing by the side, does not interfere with his actions.
5) Upon reaching the edge, he climbs out of the pool using the ladder, marking the end of the process from preparation to exit from the pool.
