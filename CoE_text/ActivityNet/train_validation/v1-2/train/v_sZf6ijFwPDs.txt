1) The video features a woman in a black top standing behind a bar counter, preparing a drink.
2) She begins by pouring ice into a glass, which is the first step to cool down the drink and prepare it for the other ingredients.
3) Then, she adds Bacardi Oakheart rum and Cointreau liqueur (or clear and yellow liquors from bottles labeled 'Bacardi' and 'Jose Cuervo') into the glass, causing the base flavors of the cocktail to be established.
4) Next, she pours orange juice from a carton into the glass, which mixes with the alcohol and causes the creation of a fruity flavor profile.
5) After that, she adds a splash of grenadine syrup from a small bottle, which not only enhances the taste but also changes the color of the drink, making it more visually appealing.
6) Finally, she squeezes an orange slice over the drink and garnishes it with the same, along with adding a straw, completing the preparation process and enhancing the overall presentation.
