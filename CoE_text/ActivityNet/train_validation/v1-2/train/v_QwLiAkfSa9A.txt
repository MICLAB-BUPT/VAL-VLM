1) The woman decides to get her nose pierced, causing her to visit a piercing studio.
2) In the brightly lit room with green walls, the tattooed piercer, dressed in black gloves and a denim vest, prepares for the procedure, which leads to him marking the area on her nose.
3) After marking, the piercer cleans her nose with a tissue, which is a necessary step before piercing to ensure the area is sterile.
4) The act of cleaning the nose then causes the piercer to proceed with using a needle to pierce her nose.
5) Following the piercing, the piercer inserts a barbell (or a piece of jewelry), as this is the next logical step after creating the hole.
6) The completion of the piercing allows the woman to sit up and examine her new piercing, while the piercer continues to clean around the area to prevent infection.
