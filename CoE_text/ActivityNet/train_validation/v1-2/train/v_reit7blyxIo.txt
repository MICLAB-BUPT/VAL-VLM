1) The video begins with a man lying in bed, scratching his face and neck.
2) This discomfort causes him to sit up and look around the dimly lit room.
3) He then stands in front of a mirror, holding an electric razor, which leads to him starting to shave his beard.
4) As he shaves, hair falls into the sink below, causing the sink to collect the shaved-off hair.
5) After shaving, he rinses his face in the sink and examines his clean-shaven face in the mirror, resulting in him appearing content.
6) Finally, he lies back down on the bed, still feeling satisfied from the grooming process.
