1) The video begins with a view from the front of a sailboat, showing the deck and the calm, overcast sea ahead, causing the setting to be established for the sailing event.
2) A person in a wetsuit is seen adjusting the ropes and preparing to sail, which causes the boat to be ready for navigation.
3) They sit on the edge of the boat, holding onto the ropes, and then lie down on their stomach, using their legs to steer the boat, leading to the commencement of the sailing activity.
4) The camera angle shifts underwater, showing the person's legs and the ropes as they navigate through the water, which provides a detailed perspective of the steering process.
5) The person then resurfaces, continuing to steer the boat while lying down, indicating the ongoing nature of the sailing.
6) As he sails, he occasionally looks around and adjusts his position, which ensures the course and safety of the journey.
7) The video ends with a black screen displaying credits, thanking Graham for letting them mail the camera to his dinghy and mentioning that the daggerboard design is not attached to the boat, concluding the sailing demonstration.
