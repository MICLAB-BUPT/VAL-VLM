1) The video showcases a person cleaning a camouflage-patterned sneaker in a stainless steel sink, which is located in the kitchen.
2) Initially, the sneaker is placed under running water to rinse off dirt and debris, causing the initial layer of dirt to be removed.
3) The individual then applies a white cleaning solution from a tube (or toothpaste as an alternative cleaning agent) onto the shoe's sole using a toothbrush, causing the cleaning agent to come into contact with the dirty areas.
4) They scrub the sole thoroughly, ensuring all areas are covered with the solution, which causes the dirt and grime to loosen and detach from the shoe's surface.
5) After scrubbing, they rinse the shoe again under running water, removing the cleaning solution and loosened dirt, which results in a cleaner shoe.
6) Finally, they use a yellow cloth to wipe down the shoe, focusing on the sole and sides, making sure it is completely dry and clean, which leads to the completion of the cleaning process.
