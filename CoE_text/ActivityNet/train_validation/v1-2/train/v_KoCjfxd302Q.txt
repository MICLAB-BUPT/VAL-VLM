1) A young boy is standing on a stool in front of a kitchen sink, which causes him to be at an appropriate height to reach the sink.
2) The boy is washing dishes with a sponge and a green brush, causing the dishes to become clean as he scrubs them under running water from the faucet.
3) The sink is filled with soapy water, and there are several dishes in it, which causes the environment to be suitable for dishwashing.
4) The boy is looking at the dishes as he washes them, which causes his actions to be deliberate and careful.
5) A woman comes over to help him with the dishes, which causes some of the workload to be shared.
6) She takes some of the dishes from the boy and puts them in the dishwasher, which causes the process of cleaning the dishes to be more efficient.
7) The boy continues to wash the remaining dishes, which causes all the dishes to eventually be cleaned.
