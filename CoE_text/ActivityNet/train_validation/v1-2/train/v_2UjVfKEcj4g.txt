1) The video begins with a close-up of the dirty suede shoes, setting the stage for the cleaning and refurbishing process.
2) The person uses a ruler to scrape off the worst dirt, which is the initial step to remove the most visible and stubborn debris from the shoes.
3) After scraping, they brush the shoes with a suede brush, causing the loosened dirt to be removed and the nap of the suede to be lifted.
4) They then spray the shoes with a cleaning solution (referred to as a white spray in Answer 2), allowing it to soak for 15 minutes, which causes the remaining dirt and stains to break down, making them easier to remove.
5) Following the soaking period, the shoes are brushed again, further removing any residual dirt and helping to restore the texture of the suede.
6) Next, dye is sprayed onto the shoes to restore their color, ensuring an even coverage, which addresses the discoloration caused by wear and the cleaning process.
7) Finally, metal heel and toe caps are applied to the shoes using a machine, adding durability and completing the restoration process.
