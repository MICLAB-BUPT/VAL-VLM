1) In a warmly lit room with orange walls, two musicians are preparing for a performance, which causes the environment to suggest a home studio setup with soundproofing panels on the walls.
2) The preparation for the performance leads to one musician, wearing glasses and a black shirt, being seated at a piano, focused on the keys, while another musician in a red t-shirt stands behind him, adjusting equipment near a drum set.
3) After the preparations, the man in the red shirt starts playing the drums by standing up and hitting the drums with drumsticks, which causes the other man, now described as having long hair and glasses, to play the piano by sitting down and pressing the keys.
