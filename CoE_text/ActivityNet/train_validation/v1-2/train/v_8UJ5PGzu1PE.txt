1) The video starts with a close-up of a hay bale and a target in the background, setting the scene for an archery event.
2) A person, dressed in a safari outfit complete with a hat and a quiver of arrows, places a bottle on the hay bale and adjusts it, preparing the specific target for their practice or challenge.
3) The individual then takes out an arrow from his quiver, loads it onto his bow, and prepares to shoot, indicating the start of the action.
4) They draw the bowstring back, aim at the target, and release the arrow, causing the arrow to fly towards the target as the camera follows its trajectory.
5) After releasing the arrow, the person looks towards the target, observing the result of their shot, which is a natural reaction to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of their attempt.
6) The scene ends with a close-up of the target, showing an arrow embedded in it, which is the consequence of the successful shot.
