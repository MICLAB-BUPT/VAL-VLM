1) The video begins with a close-up shot of a plate filled with penne pasta mixed with a rich tomato sauce, garnished with grated cheese, setting the stage for the preparation of a delicious pasta dish.
2) The scene transitions to show two sausages being sliced in a white dish on a wooden surface, which is the initial step in preparing the sausage ragu.
3) The person then places the sliced sausages into a pot and cooks them until they are browned, causing the release of flavors that will enrich the ragu.
4) Chopped herbs are added to the pot, enhancing the aroma and taste of the cooking sausage, which contributes to the overall flavor profile of the dish.
5) A can of tomato sauce is poured into the pot and stirred together with the sausage and herbs, creating a vibrant, flavorful base for the pasta.
6) In another part of the process, ground meat is cooked and stirred with a wooden spoon in a separate pot, adding an additional layer of richness to the sauce.
7) Fresh green herbs are added to the ground meat mixture, followed by the addition of a creamy liquid, likely cream or milk, which is stirred into the meat, causing the creation of a smooth, homogeneous sauce when combined with the red, possibly tomato-based, sauce that is also added.
8) The cooked penne pasta is added to the sauce, integrating all the ingredients and ensuring that the pasta is well-coated and infused with the flavors of the ragu.
9) The final dish is served in a white bowl, sprinkled with grated cheese, completing the presentation and inviting the viewer to enjoy the meal.
