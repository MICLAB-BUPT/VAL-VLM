1) The video opens with a title card reading 'FUNNY OR DIE EXCLUSIVE' in bold, colorful letters against a black background, which causes the transition to an outdoor archery range.
2) At the archery range, a woman in a red and white shirt and blue cap is seen preparing to shoot an arrow from her bow, leading to her engaging in archery by aiming and shooting arrows at targets placed at various distances.
3) The scene shifts to another woman in a pink shirt and red cap aiming at balloons on a target, then to a man in a light blue shirt holding a bow and arrow, but the focus returns to the first woman who demonstrates precision and skill in her archery practice.
4) The first woman's targets include circular targets with concentric rings of different colors, balloons, and a watermelon on a table covered with a red and white checkered cloth, which causes the video to cut to a close-up of the watermelon being smashed with a hammer.
5) She is also seen aiming at a target with a movie poster behind it, which leads to the video concluding with a cityscape view and a call to action to subscribe now, with the 'Funny or Die' logo prominently displayed.
