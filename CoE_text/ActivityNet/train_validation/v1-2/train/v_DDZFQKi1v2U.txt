1) The video shows a young woman lying on a couch, which is caused by her preparing to undergo a nipple piercing procedure.
2) Another person, wearing a white shirt and red bandana, applies something to her chest, which is a step in the process of piercing her nipple.
3) The woman on the couch appears to be in discomfort or pain, but this contrasts with the fact that she is actually smiling throughout the process, indicating that any appearance of discomfort might be due to the anticipation or the nature of the procedure rather than actual pain.
4) The person applying the substance (the piercer) seems focused on the task, which is directly related to her using a piercing tool to carefully and professionally perform the nipple piercing.
