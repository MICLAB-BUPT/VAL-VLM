1) The video shows a young man in a blue shirt and white shorts preparing to pole vault indoors.
2) He starts by holding the pole, which causes him to be ready for the run.
3) Then he runs down the track towards the vaulting area, which allows him to build up speed.
4) As he approaches the bar, he plants the pole into the box, which enables him to transfer his horizontal momentum into vertical propulsion.
5) Using the planted pole, he propels himself upwards, which results in him successfully clearing the bar.
6) After clearing the bar, he lands on the mat, which ensures his safety upon completion of the vault.
