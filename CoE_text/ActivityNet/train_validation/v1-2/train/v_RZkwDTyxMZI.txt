1) A young boy is seen standing in front of an ironing board, holding a toy iron.
2) He pretends to iron a blue t-shirt with a cartoon character on it, moving the toy iron back and forth across the shirt, mimicking the motions of ironing, which causes him to believe he is actually ironing.
3) The boy picks up a book from the floor and looks at it briefly, causing a temporary interruption to his pretend ironing.
4) He returns to his pretend ironing, occasionally adjusting the shirt's position on the board, which allows him to continue his play activity.
5) After finishing, he puts down the toy iron and walks away from the ironing board, indicating that he has completed his pretend task.
