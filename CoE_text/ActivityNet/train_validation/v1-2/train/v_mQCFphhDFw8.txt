1) The video starts with a man in a yellow shirt and black shorts standing next to a bicycle.
2) He removes the tire from the rim, revealing the inner tube, causing him to be able to access the inner tube for repair.
3) The man then uses a tool to puncture the inner tube, simulating a flat tire, which necessitates the need for repair.
4) He applies glue to the punctured area on the inner tube, allowing the patch to adhere properly.
5) After applying the patch, he reattaches the inner tube to the tire, ensuring that the repaired section is secure.
6) He then places the tire back onto the rim of the bicycle, leading to the reassembly of the wheel.
7) Finally, he inflates the tire using an air pump, checks the tire's inflation, and ensures it is properly seated before riding away, confirming the successful repair.
