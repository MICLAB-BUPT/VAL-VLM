1) The man, wearing a yellow tank top and black shorts, starts by running on a red track with a pole in his hands, which causes him to build up the necessary speed for the pole vault.
2) He then plants the pole into the box, which allows him to use it as leverage to propel himself upwards over the high bar set against a blue sky.
3) As he propels himself, his body fully extends to clear the bar, which is supported by two vertical stands, and after clearing the bar, he releases the pole.
4) Releasing the pole causes him to fall onto a large blue landing mat, completing the pole vault action.
