1) The video starts with a man in a gym setting, wearing a black tank top with the text 'BEAST MODE' and black shorts, standing on a green floor.
2) He is holding a barbell with weights on each end, which causes him to bend down to grip it.
3) The man begins by performing a deadlift exercise, lifting the barbell from the ground to his waist level while keeping his back straight, which transitions into a squat position.
4) Lowering the barbell down towards his thighs before standing back up, he then performs a clean and jerk, lifting the barbell from the ground to his shoulders and then pushing it overhead until his arms are fully extended.
5) After completing the exercise, he lowers the barbell back to the ground and stands upright, maintaining proper form and technique throughout the process.
6) The background includes gym equipment such as medicine balls, weight racks, mats, and exercise balls, indicating a workout environment.
