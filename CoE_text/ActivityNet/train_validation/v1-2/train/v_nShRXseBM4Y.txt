1) The video starts with a title card introducing the recipe for making a chocolate sandwich.
2) This introduction causes the person to begin the preparation, starting by slicing bread and placing chocolate on it.
3) Simultaneously, the person pours milk into a bowl, which leads to them cracking an egg into the same bowl and whisking these ingredients together, causing a mixture to be created for dipping or coating the bread.
4) The preparation of the ingredients causes the person to proceed with placing the bread slices (with chocolate) onto a griddle, initiating the cooking process.
5) The act of cooking the sandwich on the griddle, including flipping it to ensure both sides are cooked, causes the sandwich to turn golden brown, indicating that it is properly cooked.
6) Once the sandwich is cooked, this action leads the person to serve the sandwich, in one scenario, with ice cream, and in another, by sprinkling powdered sugar over it, completing the dish.
