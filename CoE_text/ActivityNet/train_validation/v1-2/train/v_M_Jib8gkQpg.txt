1) The man, wearing blue swim trunks, stands on the white diving board above a swimming pool, preparing to perform a backflip.
2) He jumps off the diving board, initiating the action that causes his body to rotate in mid-air as he attempts the backflip.
3) However, during the rotation, he loses control, which causes him to land awkwardly on his back in the pool, instead of entering feet first as intended.
4) Despite the unsuccessful landing, the water splashes up when he hits it, indicating the force of his entry.
5) After resurfacing from the water, he then swims towards the edge of the pool, concluding the sequence of actions.
