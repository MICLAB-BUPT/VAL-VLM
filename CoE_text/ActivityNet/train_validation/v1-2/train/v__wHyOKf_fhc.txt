2) This introduction causes the scene to shift to a couple dancing salsa on a wooden floor against a dark purple backdrop, both wearing matching blue and white checkered shirts and jeans.
3) The dancers, through their attire, cause the viewer to recognize them as the same performers from the title card, now engaging in an energetic and rhythmic dance, performing various salsa moves, including spins, turns, and coordinated steps, which showcases their skills and synchronization.
4) Their performance, characterized by its energy and coordination, leads to the conclusion of the video, featuring a title card with the text "Cumbia Con Sabor" and an advertisement for a DVD titled "Cumbia Con Sabor Level 1 - Beginner Level," available at "bachatafusion.com."
5) The combination of the dance routine and the final advertisement suggests that the purpose of the video is to promote the "Cumbia Con Sabor" DVD, thereby causing potential viewers to visit "bachatafusion.com" for more information or to purchase the instructional material.
