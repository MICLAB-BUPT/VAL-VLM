1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'Kodak Shoe Art Film' and 'Tips & Tricks', which causes the viewer to understand the context of the content that will be presented.
2) The next frame, showing a close-up of a white sneaker with colorful art film, leads to the text at the bottom of the screen providing instructions on when and how to remove or replace the material, causing the viewer to prepare for the demonstration.
3) The person uses a tool to peel off one corner of the art film from the shoe, which initiates the process of removing the existing design, leading to the full removal of the art film, revealing the white surface underneath.
4) After the art film is completely removed, the person wipes down the shoe with a damp cloth, an action caused by the need to ensure all residue is removed before applying a new design, resulting in a clean surface ready for a new pattern or image.
