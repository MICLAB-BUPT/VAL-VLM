1) The video shows a person shaving their legs with an electric razor, which causes them to sit on the floor and carefully move the razor up and down their legs, removing hair.
2) The person starts by holding the razor in one hand, causing them to use the other hand to pull their skin taut, which allows for a closer and more effective shave.
3) They then carefully shave their leg, moving the razor up and down in smooth strokes, which results in the removal of hair from their legs.
4) The process is continued until all of their legs are shaved, which leads to the completion of the leg-shaving activity.
