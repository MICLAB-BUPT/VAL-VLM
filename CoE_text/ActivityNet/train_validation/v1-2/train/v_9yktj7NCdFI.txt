1) The video shows two children, a boy and a girl, playing on a sidewalk.
2) They are using chalk to draw hopscotch squares on the pavement, which causes them to have a structured game to play.
3) After they finish drawing, the girl starts to play hopscotch alone, hopping through the squares she has drawn, leading the way by hopping on one foot, then two feet, and finally landing on her bottom to complete the course.
4) The boy follows her, mimicking her movements with enthusiasm, which results in both of them continuing to play together.
