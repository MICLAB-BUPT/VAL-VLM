1) The chef, dressed in a white chef's coat and striped apron, begins by chopping ingredients like tomatoes and herbs on a green cutting board, which causes the preparation of the base ingredients for the dish.
2) The chopped ingredients are then added to a pan with squid rings and other vegetables, causing the creation of the sauce for the pasta.
3) Simultaneously, the pasta is being cooked separately, which will later be combined with the sauce, leading to the integration of all components of the dish.
4) The chef adds herbs and spices to the dish, enhancing the flavor and aroma, which contributes to the overall taste and quality of the final product.
5) After the pasta and sauce are combined, the final dish is plated, garnished with herbs, and presented to the camera, resulting in a visually appealing and appetizing meal.
