1) The video shows a man in a red shirt and black shorts preparing to throw a javelin on an outdoor track field, where he is surrounded by other people, some of whom are also holding javelins.
2) He starts by holding the javelin above his head, then runs forward with it, building momentum as he approaches the throwing line.
3) This build-up of momentum causes him to throw the javelin with great force.
4) The forceful throw causes the javelin to fly through the air, landing far down the field.
5) After throwing, the man watches the javelin's flight path, which leads to him turning and walking back towards the starting point.
