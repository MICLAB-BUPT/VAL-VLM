1) The person starts by placing the box on the table, which causes them to begin wrapping it with aluminum foil.
2) Ensuring that all sides of the box are covered with the foil causes the person to use a tool (scissors in answer 1, unspecified tool in answer 2) to cut the excess foil off and then fold the edges over the box.
3) After folding the edges, the person secures the foil around the box with tape, causing the wrap to be tightly secured.
4) Picking up the wrapped box and showing it to the camera is caused by the completion of the wrapping process, allowing the person to explain the process and provide tips for wrapping boxes with aluminum foil.
