1) The video begins with an exterior shot of a barber shop, showcasing its name 'Barber' and the address '102', which causes the scene to transition to the interior where two men are present; one is seated in a barber chair while the other stands beside him.
2) The standing man, wearing a white t-shirt and a towel around his neck, appears to be explaining something to the seated man, which leads to the standing man using clippers to trim the hair on the sides of the seated man's head, who has his hair partially clipped up.
3) The process continues with the standing man meticulously trimming the hair on the back and sides of the seated man's head, ensuring a neat and even cut, and he also uses scissors to trim the top of the client's hair, making precise cuts with both clippers and scissors, which demonstrates precision and care.
4) Throughout the haircut, the barber uses a comb to lift sections of hair for better visibility and control, which allows him to work efficiently on different sections of the client's hair.
5) After the cutting and trimming, the standing man styles the seated man's hair, applying a product from a container labeled 'spray' and using his hands to shape and style it, which ensures the hair is neatly arranged.
6) The standing man then uses a hairdryer to set the hairstyle, directing the airflow towards the seated man's hair, which leads to the final adjustments being made by the standing man to the seated man's hair, ensuring it looks polished and well-groomed.
7) The video concludes with the barber giving the client a final check, making sure the haircut meets his satisfaction.
