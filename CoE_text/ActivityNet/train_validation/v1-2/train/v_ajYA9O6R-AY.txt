1) The girl, wearing a striped shirt and white shorts, starts by standing at the beginning of the hopscotch grid on a driveway, which is set in a residential neighborhood with houses, trees, and a fire hydrant.
2) She then begins to play hopscotch, causing her to hop on one foot, then two feet, and then one foot again, as she follows the pattern of the grid, demonstrating coordination and balance.
3) As part of the game, she throws a small object onto the hopscotch grid, which causes her to adjust her hopping to avoid the object, while continuing to follow the rules of the game.
