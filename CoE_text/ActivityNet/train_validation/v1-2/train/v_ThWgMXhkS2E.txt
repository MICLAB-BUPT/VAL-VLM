1) The man starts by spraying the glass with a cleaning solution, which is the initial step in his cleaning process.
2) The application of the cleaning solution causes the dirt and grime on the glass to loosen, making it easier to remove.
3) After the solution has been applied, the man uses a squeegee to wipe the glass, which causes the loosened dirt and excess solution to be removed from the surface.
4) To ensure that all residues and remaining dirt are eliminated, the man then uses a cloth to wipe down the glass, causing the glass to become completely clean.
