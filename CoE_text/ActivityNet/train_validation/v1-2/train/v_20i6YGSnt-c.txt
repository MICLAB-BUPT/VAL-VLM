1) The video begins with a title card that reads 'THE BIG SHAVE' in white text on a black background, which causes the scene to transition to a man standing in front of a mirror, holding an electric razor.
2) The man, wearing a black shirt and having a beard, starts shaving his beard, moving the razor up and down his face, causing his facial hair to gradually disappear and revealing his clean-shaven face.
3) After his entire face is clean-shaven, the man then moves on to shave his head, using the same razor to remove hair from his scalp, showing his focus and determination as he completes the task of shaving both his beard and head.
