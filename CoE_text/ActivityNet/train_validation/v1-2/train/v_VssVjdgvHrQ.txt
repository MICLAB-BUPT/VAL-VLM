1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'CTESkills.com' and 'CNA Skill #1 Hand Washing', setting the context for the demonstration.
2) A person in teal scrubs is shown standing at a white sink, turning on the water, which initiates the hand-washing process.
3) The person wets their hands, causing them to be ready for the application of soap.
4) They apply soap from a dispenser, leading to the next step where they rub their hands together thoroughly to create lather, ensuring proper cleaning.
5) Rinsing under running water follows, removing the soap and any dirt or germs, resulting in clean hands.
6) Drying hands with a paper towel causes the hands to become dry, completing the cleaning process.
7) The person uses the same paper towel to turn off the faucet, avoiding direct contact and preventing recontamination, then discards the used towel into a trash bin, maintaining hygiene.
8) The video concludes with a thank you message to Lamar State College in Orange, Texas, for using their facilities and expertise, followed by the 'CTESkills.com' logo and website address, providing acknowledgment and further information.
