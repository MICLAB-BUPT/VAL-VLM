1) The man in a black suit and white shirt stands behind a table with various cocktail-making tools and ingredients, which causes the viewer to focus on his actions and the process.
2) He begins by mashing mint leaves in a glass using a wooden pestle, which releases the essential oils from the mint, causing a more flavorful base for the mojito.
3) Adding sugar to the glass after mashing the mint leaves causes the sugar to mix with the mint oils and lime juice, which he adds next, leading to the creation of a sweet and tangy mixture.
4) Pouring rum into a jigger before adding it to the glass ensures that the correct amount of alcohol is used, which contributes to the balanced flavor of the drink.
5) Adding ice cubes from a container to the glass cools down the mixture, which prepares the drink for serving and enhances its refreshing quality.
6) Pouring club soda into the glass causes the mojito to become a fizzy and invigorating beverage, completing the recipe.
7) Garnishing the drink with a sprig of mint and presenting the completed mojito to the camera serves as a final step, which highlights the visual appeal and freshness of the cocktail.
