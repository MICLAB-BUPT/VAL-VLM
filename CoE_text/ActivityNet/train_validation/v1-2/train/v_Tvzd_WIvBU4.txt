1) The man is in a rural or semi-rural area, which causes him to have access to logs of wood and the space to operate a wood splitter machine.
2) The man's decision to wear a blue jacket and gloves is caused by the outdoor conditions and the need for protection while handling logs and operating machinery.
3) The man places logs onto the wood splitter, which then causes the machine to split them into smaller, manageable pieces.
4) The efficiency of the wood splitter machine and the man's skill in handling the logs cause the process to be repetitive and systematic.
5) The man's focus and careful positioning of each log on the splitter cause the task to be performed effectively, resulting in neatly stacked split wood.
