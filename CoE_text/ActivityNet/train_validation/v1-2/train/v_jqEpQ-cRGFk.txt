1) The elderly woman is lying in a hospital bed, covered with a white blanket, and wearing a nasal cannula for oxygen, indicating she may be in a state of rest or possibly unconscious.

3) The person carefully brushes through the elderly woman's white hair, starting from the top and moving downwards, ensuring it is smooth and untangled, which could cause an improvement in the woman's overall appearance and possibly her comfort.
