1) A young girl with red hair, wearing a striped shirt and black pants, decides to play hopscotch on a sidewalk.
2) The sidewalk is prepared for the game, as it is lined with chalk drawings of squares and rectangles, which causes the girl to have a designated path to follow.
3) The girl starts to hop through the hopscotch course, carefully landing on one foot or two feet in each square, which is a result of her following the rules of the game and the layout of the chalk drawings.
