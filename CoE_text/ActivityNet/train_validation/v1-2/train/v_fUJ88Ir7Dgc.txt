1) The video begins with a title screen introducing Jarred Roth, a senior high school athlete preparing for a high jump event, which causes the scene to transition to an outdoor track and field setting at night, illuminated by bright stadium lights.
2) In the setting, a male athlete in a black and white uniform (also described as a black tank top and shorts) is seen walking on the track, stretching, and mentally preparing for his jump, which leads to the camera capturing various angles of the athlete's movements, showcasing his focus and determination.
3) As he approaches the high jump bar, he takes a few steps back, then runs towards it, which results in him leaping over the bar and landing on the mat.
4) The crowd cheers as he successfully completes the jump, which causes the video to conclude with the athlete sitting on the track, reflecting on his performance.
