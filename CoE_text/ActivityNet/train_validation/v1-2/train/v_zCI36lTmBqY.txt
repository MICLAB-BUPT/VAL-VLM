1) The video shows a man sitting on a chair in a room, which causes him to be in a stationary position.
2) He is wearing a white shirt and glasses, which does not directly cause any action but describes his appearance.
3) The presence of a hookah in front of him causes the man to smoke from it.
4) Smoking the hookah leads to him blowing smoke rings into the air.
5) The smoke rings become visible as they float around the room, caused by the act of him blowing them.
6) The man continues to smoke the hookah, which causes him to repeatedly blow smoke rings throughout the video.
7) Occasionally, he takes sips from a cup, indicating that drinking is an additional activity he engages in, separate from smoking.
8) The background, including a framed picture on the wall and a computer monitor, sets the scene but does not cause or affect the actions described.
