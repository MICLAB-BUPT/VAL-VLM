1) The man, dressed in a green jacket and blue jeans, is standing on a wooden deck, holding an axe with a yellow handle, which causes him to be prepared for the task of chopping wood.
2) He swings the axe down onto a log placed on a chopping block, causing the log to split into two pieces.
3) After splitting the log, he picks up one of the pieces and places it back on the chopping block, which sets up the next action.
4) He then swings the axe again, resulting in the log being split into smaller pieces.
5) The man continues to chop wood until the log is completely split, indicating his thoroughness in the task.
6) The background, showing a neatly stacked pile of firewood against a stone wall, surrounded by a forested area, and the ground covered with sawdust and wood chips, suggests that this area is frequently used for chopping wood, providing context for the activity.
