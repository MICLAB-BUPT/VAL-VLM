1) The video features a man in a striped blue and white polo shirt playing an acoustic guitar in a room with pink walls, which causes the camera to capture his upper body and the guitar from above.
2) His strumming of the guitar strings with his right hand and moving his left hand up and down the neck to press on the strings creates different chords, causing him to display facial expressions of concentration and engagement with the music.
3) After playing the guitar for a while, he switches to playing a silver flute, causing him to hold the flute horizontally with both hands and blow into it to produce sound.
