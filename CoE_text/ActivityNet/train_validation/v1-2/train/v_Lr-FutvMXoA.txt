1) The video begins with a male athlete, among others, preparing for pole vaulting in both indoor and outdoor settings, which sets the stage for the series of attempts.
2) The athletes' running with the pole towards the vaulting area causes them to build up the necessary momentum for the jump.
3) Planting the pole into the box at the right moment then propels the athletes upwards, allowing them to reach the height needed to clear the bar.
4) Twisting their bodies mid-air is a technique used by the athletes to successfully clear the bar, showcasing their skill and precision.
5) Successfully clearing the bar leads to a safe landing on the padded mat, demonstrating the successful completion of the pole vault.
6) In some instances, failing to execute the twist or not having enough momentum causes the athletes to fail in clearing the bar, resulting in a fall onto the mat.
