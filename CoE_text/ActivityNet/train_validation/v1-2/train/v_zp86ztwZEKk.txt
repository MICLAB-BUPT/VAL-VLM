1) The man in a green shirt and white shorts is standing on an outdoor sports field, which is likely a lacrosse field, causing the environment to be overcast with diffused natural light, suggesting it might be early morning or late afternoon.
2) The presence of goalposts, trees, and a few people walking around, along with visible markings for sports including numbers indicating yard lines, causes the scene to have a muted color palette, dominated by greens from the field and grays from the sky.
3) The man, who is also wearing a watch and a yellow wristband, is speaking to the camera, which causes him to appear as if he is giving instructions or commentary related to the game.
4) The fact that there are other individuals in athletic attire, possibly players or coaches, moving across the field, and some people in the background playing lacrosse, suggests that the man's role is that of a coach or commentator, thereby providing context for his actions.
