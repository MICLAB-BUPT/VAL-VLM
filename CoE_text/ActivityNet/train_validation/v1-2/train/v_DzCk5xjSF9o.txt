1) The video shows a person preparing sushi rolls in a kitchen setting.
2) They start by spreading a mixture onto a sheet of nori (seaweed), which causes the ingredients to adhere to the seaweed, forming the base of the sushi roll.
3) Then, the person rolls it up tightly using a bamboo mat, which helps shape and compress the roll, ensuring all the ingredients stay together.
4) After the rolling, the person cuts the rolled sushi into bite-sized pieces using a knife, which results in uniform, manageable portions for serving.
5) The finished sushi rolls are arranged on a plate with chopsticks, and some are garnished with a flower, which enhances the presentation of the dish.
