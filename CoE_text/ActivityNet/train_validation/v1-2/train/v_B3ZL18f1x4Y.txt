2) This scene shifts to ingredients like mushrooms, onions, beef, bread, mustard, and butter laid out on a wooden table, causing the person to start the preparation process by chopping onions and mushrooms.
3) The chopped ingredients are then sautéed in a pan with melted butter, leading to the seasoning of the mixture.
4) A loaf of bread is cut and hollowed out, creating a cavity that causes the cooked mixture to be placed inside it.
