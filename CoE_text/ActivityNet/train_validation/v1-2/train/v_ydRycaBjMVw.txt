1) The man sits on a black leather chair in a piercing studio, indicating he is there to get an ear piercing.
2) The piercer, wearing black gloves, begins to prepare for the procedure, which causes the man to look at his phone, possibly to pass the time or distract himself.
3) The preparation of the man's ear by the piercer, including cleaning and using various tools, leads to the careful insertion of the needle into the man's earlobe.
4) After successfully completing the piercing, the action of removing the needle causes the piercer to clean the area around the new piercing with a cotton swab, ensuring it is hygienic and reducing the risk of infection.
