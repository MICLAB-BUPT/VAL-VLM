1) The video begins with a man standing in front of a door, holding a cigarette, which causes the scene to transition to a close-up of the cigarette burning.
2) The man, dressed in dark clothing and appearing alone in a dimly lit room, takes a drag from the cigarette, leading to a detailed animated sequence showing the journey of the smoke through the human body.
3) The animation starts by showing the smoke traveling through the lungs and into the bloodstream, which then leads to the depiction of the smoke's movement through the heart and eventually reaching the brain.
4) The conclusion of the video, caused by the completion of the animated sequences, features a message on a white background, encouraging viewers to seek help for smoking cessation or directing them to 'For your way out of smoking search Smokefree.'
