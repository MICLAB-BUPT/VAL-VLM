1) The person lies on their back, causing their belly button to be exposed.
2) A medical professional, dressed in a light-colored shirt, approaches and uses a tool to create an incision on the person's lower abdomen, which causes the skin to be prepared for the piercing.
3) The medical professional then inserts a needle through the incision, causing a hole to be created for the jewelry.
4) After the needle is removed, the medical professional inserts a piece of jewelry into the newly created hole, resulting in a belly button piercing.
5) The medical professional carefully adjusts and secures the jewelry in place, ensuring that the piercing is properly set.
