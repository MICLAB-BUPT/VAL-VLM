3) However, he loses his balance and falls off the beam onto the mat below, which causes him to get up and try again.
4) But, he falls off the beam once more, leading to the end of the video with him lying on the mat, seemingly exhausted from the failed attempts.
5) In an alternate scenario, after starting by standing on the beam and jumping and flipping in the air, he successfully lands back on the beam.
6) This success allows him to continue performing various gymnastic moves, including handstands and flips, while maintaining his balance on the beam.
7) His movements are fluid and controlled, demonstrating his skill and athleticism.
