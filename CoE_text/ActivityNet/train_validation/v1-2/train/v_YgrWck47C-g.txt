1) The video begins with a black screen displaying green text that reads 'theranger' and a small white flower-like symbol, which causes it to transition to a black background with white text stating the importance of handwashing during flu season.
2) This introduction leads to a scene showing a person, identified as Brian Hill from the Drama department, standing in front of a tiled wall, which then causes him to demonstrate handwashing.
3) The demonstration starts with turning on the faucet and wetting his hands under running water, causing him to apply soap from a dispenser and lather his hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds.
4) After the lathering process, he rinses his hands under the running water, which causes him to use a paper towel to turn off the faucet.
5) Finally, he dries his hands with another paper towel, which causes the video to conclude with tips for preventing the flu, including avoiding contact with sick people, staying home when sick, covering the mouth or nose when coughing or sneezing, washing hands often, and practicing good health habits like getting plenty of sleep and eating nutritious food.
