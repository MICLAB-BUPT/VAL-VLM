1) A woman wearing a gray hoodie, black leggings, and pink sneakers is practicing hockey in a room.
2) The room has wooden lockers, which causes the setting to appear more like a locker room or a space designed for sports activities.
3) She is holding a green hockey stick and repeatedly hitting a small white ball on the floor, which indicates that she is actively engaged in honing her hockey skills.
4) The presence of a brown couch to the left side of the frame suggests the room may also serve as a relaxation or waiting area.
5) The lighting appears to be artificial, coming from ceiling fixtures, causing the environment to be well-lit, suitable for indoor practice.
