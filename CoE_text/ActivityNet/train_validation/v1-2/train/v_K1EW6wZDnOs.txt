1) The person in the video begins by holding a hose and nozzle, directing water towards the horse's face, which causes the horse to move its head closer to the nozzle, seemingly enjoying the water spray.
2) After the horse is sufficiently wet, the person then uses a red-handled brush to groom the horse's face and neck area, ensuring it is clean and well-maintained, which leads to the horse appearing calm and cooperative during the grooming process.
3) The entire event takes place in an outdoor setting with trees and a wooden fence visible in the distance.
