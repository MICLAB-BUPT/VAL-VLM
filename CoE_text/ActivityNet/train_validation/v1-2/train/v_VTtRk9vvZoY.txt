1) The video shows a person preparing to start a fire outdoors, gathering kindling such as twigs and dry grass, and arranging them in a small pile.
2) The arrangement of the kindling and wood is done in a specific pattern to ensure there is enough space for airflow, which causes the fire to ignite more efficiently.
3) The person then uses a lighter to ignite the kindling, creating a small flame that gradually grows larger, and carefully places it among the wood.
4) As the fire catches on, the person adds larger pieces of wood to sustain it, and also uses a can of hand sanitizer as a fuel source to help the fire grow.
5) Throughout the process, the person adjusts the wood and kindling to maintain the fire's intensity, causing the fire to burn steadily.
6) Finally, the person steps back to observe the fire, indicating that they have successfully started and maintained the fire.
