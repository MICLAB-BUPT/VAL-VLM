1) A young child in a green and blue hoodie is brushing his teeth in front of a bathroom mirror, which causes him to hold an electric toothbrush in one hand and a manual toothbrush in the other.
2) The child alternates between the two toothbrushes while looking at his reflection, causing him to appear focused on his task.
3) The presence of various toiletries like a soap dispenser, toothpaste, and a cup holding more toothbrushes on the granite countertop provides the necessary tools for the child's dental hygiene routine.
4) The child occasionally glancing around the room, combined with the bright lighting from overhead fixtures, creates a comfortable environment for the activity.
5) Wearing a green and gray hoodie with a crest on the left side, the boy looks at himself in the mirror and smiles, indicating that he is engaged and possibly enjoying the process.
6) The availability of additional items such as a bottle of mouthwash on the sink leads the boy to turn on the faucet and rinse his mouth with water, which causes him to then turn off the faucet and continue brushing his teeth.
