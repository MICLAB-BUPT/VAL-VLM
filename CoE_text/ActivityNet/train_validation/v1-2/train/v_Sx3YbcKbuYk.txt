1) The video begins with a close-up view of a campfire pit surrounded by rocks, with logs and kindling arranged inside.
2) A hand holding a lighter appears and ignites the kindling, which includes small pieces of wood and paper, causing the small pieces to catch fire.
3) The flame from the lighter is directed towards a small piece of paper placed under the logs, causing it to catch fire.
4) The burning paper then ignites the surrounding kindling, leading to small flames that gradually grow larger as more kindling is added.
5) The flames spread through the kindling and eventually reach the larger logs, causing them to ignite.
6) The fire becomes fully established, with bright orange flames burning steadily within the pit, providing warmth and light to the surroundings.
