1) A female weightlifter in a blue and yellow singlet is at a competition, as indicated by the stage with a 'ROGUE' and 'USA Weightlifting' banner, along with spectators and judges present.
2) The weightlifter begins her performance by starting with the barbell on the floor, which causes her to squat down and grip the barbell with both hands.
3) From the squatting position, she lifts the barbell to her shoulders while standing up, which is part of the snatch lift technique, not stopping at chest level as initially described.
4) After lifting the barbell to her shoulders, she continues the motion without pause, pressing it overhead in one smooth movement, completing the snatch lift.
5) The completion of the lift with the barbell held overhead signifies the end of the action, after which she would lower the barbell back to the ground.
