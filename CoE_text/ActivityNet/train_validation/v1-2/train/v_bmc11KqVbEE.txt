1) The video begins with a black screen that transitions to a man in a blue shirt standing in front of a green screen, which is likely being used for chroma keying purposes.
2) He is holding a squeegee and a cloth, and he starts the process by using a spray bottle to apply cleaning solution to the glass surface in front of him, causing the surface to become wet or soapy.
3) After applying the cleaning solution, the man moves the squeegee back and forth across the glass, wiping away water or soap as he goes, which leads to the removal of dirt and residue from the glass.
4) To ensure the glass is completely clean, he then uses the cloth to wipe the glass, removing any remaining marks or smudges, thus achieving a spotless result.
5) Throughout the video, the man continues to clean the glass, moving the squeegee and cloth in various directions to cover the entire area, and the background remains consistent with the green screen.
