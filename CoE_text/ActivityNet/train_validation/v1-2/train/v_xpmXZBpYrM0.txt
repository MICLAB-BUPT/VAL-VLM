1) The video shows a person demonstrating how to use leg lube for shaving.
2) The person applies the leg lube to their leg, which causes the hair and skin to be prepared for a smoother shave.
3) They rinse the leg lube off in the sink, causing the removal of excess product and readying the leg for the shaving process.
4) They then shave their leg with a razor, which is enabled by the preparation from the leg lube, leading to an effective hair removal.
5) Rinsing the razor under running water follows, which removes any hair or lube residue, keeping the razor clean and functional for continued use.
6) Finally, they wipe their leg clean with a towel, resulting in a dry and smooth leg post-shave.
