1) In a spacious gymnasium, a boy in a black shirt and pants is running across the wooden floor towards a high jump bar, which causes him to prepare for an acrobatic leap.
2) As the boy reaches the high jump bar, he performs an acrobatic flip over it, which leads to him landing on his back on a blue mat.
3) The action of the boy performing the flip and landing on the mat draws the attention of another person, who is seated on the floor near the blue mat, wearing a red top and dark pants, causing them to watch the event.
