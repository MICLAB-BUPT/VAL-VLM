1) The video begins with a title screen displaying "Sex On The Beach" and "American Bartenders School," which causes the viewer to understand the context of the demonstration.
2) It then transitions to a man standing behind a bar counter, surrounded by various bottles of alcohol, where he is seen talking and gesturing with his hands, indicating that he is explaining or demonstrating something related to bartending.
3) The man picks up a clear glass and fills it with ice from a metal container, which is a preparatory step for making the cocktail, causing the foundation of the drink to be set.
4) He then pours rum, peach schnapps, and orange juice into the glass in a specific order, an action that causes the ingredients to mix properly, leading to the creation of the cocktail.
5) After adding the ingredients, he stirs the drink with a long spoon, which ensures the flavors are well combined, resulting in a consistent taste throughout the cocktail.
6) He takes a sip, likely to test the flavor, which implies the completion of the cocktail-making process.
7) The video ends with a black screen displaying the text "The End" and "American Bartenders Schools," signaling the conclusion of the instructional content.
