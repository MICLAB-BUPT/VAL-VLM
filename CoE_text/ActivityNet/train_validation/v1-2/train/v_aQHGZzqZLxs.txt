1) The video begins with a person holding a small piece of wood and a plastic bag filled with more pieces of wood, causing them to start preparing a fire.
2) The person then places the wood into a pile of sticks and twigs, which is situated on a sandy surface surrounded by rocks, causing the formation of a well-arranged structure for burning.
3) As the preparation progresses, the person uses a lighter to ignite the pile, causing small flames to appear.
4) The appearance of the flames causes the person to carefully adjust the wood and paper to maintain the fire, occasionally adding more pieces of wood to keep it going.
5) Throughout the process, the focus remains on the fire and the person's actions as they manage and tend to it, causing the fire to grow larger and stronger.
6) The video concludes with the fire burning steadily within the rock enclosure, producing smoke that rises into the air, as a result of the person's continuous efforts in managing the fire.
