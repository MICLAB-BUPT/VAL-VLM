1) The video shows a small dog, possibly a Jack Russell Terrier mix, being bathed in a white bathtub.
2) The person in the video is using a handheld showerhead to wet and rinse the dog, ensuring it is thoroughly cleaned, which causes the dog to be engaged in the bathing process.
3) The dog, wearing a collar, appears to be somewhat resistant to the bath, moving around and shaking its head, which contradicts with the statement that the dog appears to be cooperative during the bath.
4) A person's hand is visible holding the showerhead, spraying water on the dog, indicating the active role of the person in the bathing process.
5) The tub has rubber duckies floating in the water, adding a playful element to the scene, but this does not directly impact the dog's behavior or the person's actions.
6) The lighting is bright, likely from an overhead bathroom light, which enhances the visibility of the bathing activity.
