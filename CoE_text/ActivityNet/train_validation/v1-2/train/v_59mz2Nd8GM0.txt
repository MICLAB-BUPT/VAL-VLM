3) A person spreads mayonnaise on one slice of bread and a yellow condiment (likely butter or another spread) on another, which causes the bread to be prepared for layering.
4) They then layer ham and cheese between the slices, creating a sandwich, which is a step that forms the core structure of the Monte Cristo.
5) An egg is cracked into a bowl, whisked, and poured onto a hot griddle, causing a preparation of the cooking medium for the sandwich.
6) The sandwich is dipped into the egg mixture, flipped, and cooked until golden brown, which causes the outer layer to become crispy and the inside to melt.
7) Finally, the sandwich is transferred to a plate, cut in half, and sprinkled with powdered sugar, revealing melted cheese inside, which causes the completion of the dish and its presentation.
