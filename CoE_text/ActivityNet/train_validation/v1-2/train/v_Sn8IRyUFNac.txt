1) The video depicts a conversation between two women in a room, where one woman is wearing a dark blazer and white shirt, and the other is dressed in a patterned dress with a necklace.
2) The first woman, who is holding a cigarette, initiates a discussion about the impact of cigarette taxes on her smoking habits, which causes the second woman to respond with concern about the potential negative effects of cigarettes on weight loss.
3) This concern from the second woman prompts the first woman to express her desire to quit smoking due to health concerns, leading to the second woman advising against quitting, possibly because she believes that smoking helps with weight management.
4) The first woman then mentions that she has been smoking for years and has lost weight as a result, which contrasts with the second woman's experience, as she reveals that despite also smoking for years, she has gained weight instead.
5) The differing experiences of the two women regarding the effect of smoking on their weight contribute to a continued debate, ultimately causing the video to end with a black screen displaying the text "A NOTORIOUSROBO1 DOWNFALL PARODY."
