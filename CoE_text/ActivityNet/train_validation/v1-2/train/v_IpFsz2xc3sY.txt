1) The video starts with a black screen displaying white text that reads 'Curly-Wavy Hair Tutorial! No products or hair straighteners/curlers needed (only two hair bands).'
2) It then transitions to a young woman with long, wavy brown hair wearing a black top, seated in front of a white shelf filled with various items.
3) The woman begins by talking to the camera, explaining the tutorial process, which causes her to start demonstrating how to create a curly-wavy hairstyle using only two hair bands.
4) She parts her hair in the middle, which allows her to braid it tightly from the roots to the ends.
5) After completing the braid, she twists it into a bun at the back of her head, and this action leads her to use a yellow hair tie to secure the bun, ensuring it is tight and neat.
6) Throughout the process, she uses her hands to show the steps involved, including sectioning her hair, twisting it, and securing it with the hair bands, and also uses a yellow hair clip to hold sections of hair in place.
7) Finally, she releases the bun, letting her hair fall freely, which results in showcasing the curly hairstyle achieved through this process.
8) The video concludes with the woman smiling at the camera, showcasing her finished curly-wavy hairstyle.
