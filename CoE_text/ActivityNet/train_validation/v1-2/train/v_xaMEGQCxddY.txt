1) The man, dressed in a white shirt, dark shorts, and athletic shoes, starts by standing still, holding the discus in his right hand, which is the initial position for the throw.
2) He begins to spin around, building momentum as he rotates, causing his body to twist and turn with each rotation. This action is essential for generating the necessary force to propel the discus.
3) As he spins, his left arm extends outward for balance, while his right arm swings back, preparing to release the discus. This specific positioning of the arms is crucial for maintaining stability and setting up the throw.
4) After spinning around multiple times, the man releases the discus into the air, utilizing the accumulated momentum from the rotations to maximize the distance of the throw.
5) The video captures the entire sequence from various angles, highlighting the man's technique and form, and also shows the background with a chain-link fence and spectators, providing context to the outdoor sports field setting.
