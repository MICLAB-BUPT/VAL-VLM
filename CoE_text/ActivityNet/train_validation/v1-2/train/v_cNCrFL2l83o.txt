1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'Tequila Sunrise Long Drinks' and the ingredients, setting the context for the preparation of a specific cocktail.
2) A man in a black shirt standing behind a bar counter filled with various bottles of alcohol and glasses gestures towards the camera while speaking, indicating he is about to demonstrate how to make the drink, which causes him to start the preparation process.
3) He picks up a glass and fills it with ice cubes from a metal container, creating a base for the drink, which leads to the next step where he pours grenadine into the glass, followed by orange juice, to create a visually appealing layered effect.
4) The addition of tequila to the glass completes the basic composition of the Tequila Sunrise, but to ensure the drink's flavors are well integrated, he uses a spoon to stir the contents, causing the ingredients to mix thoroughly.
5) Throughout the process, his gestures and possible explanations serve to engage the viewer and provide additional information or tips related to the drink preparation, enhancing the instructional value of the demonstration.
