1) The video shows two men playing squash in an indoor court, which causes them to be actively engaged in the game.
2) One man is wearing a blue tank top and black shorts, while the other is shirtless with yellow striped shorts, causing them to be distinguishable from each other during the game.
3) They are both holding rackets and hitting a small ball against the walls of the court, which leads to them moving around the court, taking turns hitting the ball and running back and forth.
4) The court has white walls with red lines marking the boundaries, and there is a door visible on one side, which provides a clear and defined area for the game to take place.
5) The lighting appears to be artificial, coming from above, which results in the players and their actions being clearly visible.
