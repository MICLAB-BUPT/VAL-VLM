3) As he spins, he is swinging his arm to gain momentum, building up power for the throw through fluid and controlled movements.
4) The completion of his spin causes him to release the discus into the air, sending it flying through the space.
5) The background features a netted area for safety and an indoor sports facility with various sports equipment scattered around, which is set up to accommodate and ensure the safety of the practice.
