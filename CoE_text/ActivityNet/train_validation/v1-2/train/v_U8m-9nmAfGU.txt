1) The man is preparing for a bungee jump, which causes him to wear a harness and safety gear.
2) He stands on the edge of a platform, looking down at the ground below, which is surrounded by lush greenery, a river, and mountains, causing him to feel both excited and nervous.
3) His feelings of excitement and nervousness, combined with the encouragement or presence of staff or fellow jumpers, cause him to take a leap off the platform.
4) Once he leaps, he begins free-falling through the air, which changes his initial nervousness into an enjoyment of the thrilling experience.
