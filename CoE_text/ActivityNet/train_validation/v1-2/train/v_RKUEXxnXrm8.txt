1) The video starts with a man in a striped shirt standing in a kitchen, talking to the camera, which causes the scene to transition to a wooden background with text 'WARREN NASH SIMPLE COOKING VIDEOS' and 'EGG MAYONNAISE SANDWICH RECIPE'.
2) This introduction leads to the display of various ingredients on a wooden surface: two eggs, mayonnaise, fresh herbs, bread slices, and a green onion.
3) The man then demonstrates how to boil the eggs, drain them under running water, and peel the shells off, which is followed by chopping the green onion and herbs.
4) After preparing the ingredients, he mixes the boiled eggs with mayonnaise, adds chopped green onions and herbs, which results in the egg mayo mixture being spread onto a slice of bread.
5) The sandwich assembly causes the final product to be cut in half and placed on a plate, leading to the conclusion of the video with a call-to-action screen encouraging viewers to subscribe for more cooking videos.
