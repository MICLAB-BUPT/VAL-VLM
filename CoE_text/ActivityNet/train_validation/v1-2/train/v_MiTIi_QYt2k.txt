1) The video begins with a wooden bench placed on a cardboard sheet, showing signs of wear and tear.
2) A clear measuring jug is shown, and then the person pours linseed oil into it, which causes the preparation for the restoration process.
3) The mixture in the jug is stirred with a green stick, ensuring that the linseed oil is well-prepared for application.
4) The bench is wiped with a cloth to clean it thoroughly, which prepares the surface for better absorption of the oil.
5) The prepared linseed oil is applied to the bench using the cloth, specifically a red one, to rub the oil onto the wooden surface, ensuring even coverage, which initiates the restoration of the bench's appearance.
6) The process is repeated for a second coat, with the mixture being stirred again before application, to enhance the restoration effect.
7) The bench is wiped once more to remove excess oil, preventing an overly oily finish.
8) Finally, the bench is left to dry, showcasing its restored appearance, as a result of the thorough and careful application of the linseed oil.
