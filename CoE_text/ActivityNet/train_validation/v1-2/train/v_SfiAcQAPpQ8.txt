1) The video features a man standing behind a bar counter, surrounded by various bottles of alcohol, a large white jug, a pitcher, and three cans. 
2) He picks up a glass filled with ice and a red drink, then uses a red soda siphon to add more liquid from a bottle into the glass, which causes the level of the red liquid in the glass to rise.
3) After adding the red liquid, he stirs the drink with a long spoon, which mixes the contents of the glass, leading to a more homogeneous mixture.
4) Next, he adds a yellow liquid from another bottle into the glass, causing the color of the mixture to change as the new ingredient is incorporated.
5) Finally, he pours a white liquid from the large white jug into the glass, completing the drink preparation process, which results in the final mixed drink.
