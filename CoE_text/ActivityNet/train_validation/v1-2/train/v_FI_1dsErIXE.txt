1) The man in a workshop setting, wearing a beige polo shirt with the 'MARTIN' logo, is working on a wooden board placed on a workbench.
2) He applies a substance from a yellow bottle onto the board, which causes him to use a gray cloth to spread it evenly across the surface.
3) After spreading the substance, he switches to a white cloth for further polishing, which leads to the removal of any excess material and enhances the board's finish.
4) Throughout the process, his meticulous inspection of the board's surface ensures a smooth and glossy finish, causing him to run his hand over it to check for even application and texture.
