1) The video shows a young child sitting in a car seat, wearing a striped shirt with pink accents.
2) The child is holding a small object, which turns out to be a lipstick, and appears to be engaged in an activity involving the object.
3) An adult's hand is seen applying the lipstick to the child's lips, causing the child to enjoy the process, smile, and look at the camera.
4) After the application, the child takes the lipstick from the adult, which leads to the child pretending to apply it to their own lips, mimicking the earlier action.
