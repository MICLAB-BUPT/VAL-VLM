1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the preparation of a Chilean 'Hulte' (marine algae) salad, which causes the viewer to understand the subject and context of the upcoming content.
2) It then transitions to a bustling market scene where people, including a man and a woman, are interacting and examining marine products, leading to an engagement in conversation with a vendor about the hulte and other seafood items.
3) The interaction at the market, where the man holds a piece of food like a clam while the woman listens, results in them purchasing some of the seafood items from the vendor, causing the shift of the setting from the market to a kitchen.
4) In the kitchen, the man is shown cutting the purchased hulte into smaller pieces on a countertop, while the woman is seen chopping green herbs, likely cilantro, on the same countertop, which leads to the mixing of these ingredients in a bowl.
5) The process of combining the prepared hulte and herbs culminates in the creation of the finished product, a dish presented in a white bowl, which is then served and enjoyed by individuals, concluding the demonstration of the recipe.
