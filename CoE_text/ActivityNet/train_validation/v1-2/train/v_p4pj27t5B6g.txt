2) He is holding a saxophone, which causes him to gesture with his hands and point at different parts of the instrument, indicating that he is explaining or demonstrating something related to it.
3) His engagement in the demonstration, along with his facial expressions, causes the impression that he is deeply involved in providing a detailed explanation or showing specific features of the saxophone.
