1) The video begins with a pair of gray and white sneakers that are visibly dirty, with scuffs and stains.
2) A hand applies a cleaning solution, specifically 'Lincoln E-Z Cleaner', to the shoes using a toothbrush, which causes the dirt and grime to start breaking down.
3) The person then uses the toothbrush to scrub the sides and soles of the shoes, focusing on the crevices and seams, which leads to the gradual removal of the dirt and grime.
4) This thorough cleaning process, involving the application of the cleaner and the scrubbing, results in the sneakers becoming significantly cleaner.
5) The final outcome is shown with the person holding up the shoe, displaying the clean surface, which is a direct result of the effective cleaning process.
