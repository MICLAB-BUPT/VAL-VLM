1) The woman in the video starts by cutting a piece of the clear plastic bag to size using pink scissors, which is done to prepare the bag for wrapping the jar.
2) She then places the jar inside the cut plastic bag and ties it at the top, causing the jar to be enclosed within the bag.
3) After tying the top, she folds the sides of the bag over the jar and ties it again, which ensures that the jar is wrapped securely and neatly.
4) Finally, she cuts off the excess plastic bag and ties it into a bow, resulting in a tidy and aesthetically pleasing finish.
