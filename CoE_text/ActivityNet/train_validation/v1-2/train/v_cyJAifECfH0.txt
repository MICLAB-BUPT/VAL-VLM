1) The video showcases a weightlifting event where an athlete, dressed in a blue and white singlet, is seen lifting a barbell with red weights on each side.
2) The athlete begins by squatting down to grip the barbell, which causes him to be in the correct position for the initial lift.
3) Then, he proceeds to lift it off the ground, causing the transition into a clean position where the barbell is held at shoulder height.
4) After stabilizing the barbell at shoulder height, the athlete performs a jerk motion, pushing the barbell overhead while splitting his legs into a lunge position for stability, which allows him to maintain balance and control during the lift.
5) Successfully holding the barbell overhead, the athlete then drops it to the ground, which marks the completion of the lift, and steps back.
