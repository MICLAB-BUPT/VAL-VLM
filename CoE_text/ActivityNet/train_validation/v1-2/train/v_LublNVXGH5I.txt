1) The video begins with a person holding a can of glass cleaner and a roll of paper towels, which causes them to be prepared for the cleaning task.
2) They spray the glass cleaner onto the window, creating a misty effect, which allows the cleaner to spread and start breaking down dirt and smudges on the window.
3) The person then uses the paper towel (or cloth) to wipe the window clean in circular motions, removing the cleaner and any smudges, thus making the window clearer.
4) This process is repeated several times, with the person spraying and wiping the window, ensuring that the entire window is cleaned thoroughly and all spots are addressed.
5) The video ends with the person standing back and admiring their work, indicating the completion of the cleaning task and satisfaction with the result.
