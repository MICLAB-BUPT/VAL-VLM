1) The video begins with a title screen, setting the context and theme for the tutorial on creating striped nail art.
2) This is followed by the application of a clear base coat to the nails, which prepares them for the subsequent steps and ensures the longevity of the nail polish.
3) The next step involves painting the nails in a vibrant coral color, providing a base color that will be partially visible in the final design, causing a contrast with the other colors used.
4) Then, tape is cut into strips and placed strategically on the coral-painted nails, intended to create straight lines and protect parts of the coral layer from the next color application, thus enabling the creation of clean, defined stripes.
5) Turquoise nail polish is applied over the taped sections, adding another color to the design. The use of tape prevents this color from mixing with the coral, causing distinct, separate areas of color.
6) After the turquoise polish dries, the tape is carefully removed, revealing the clean, crisp lines between the coral and turquoise, as the protected areas remain untouched by the second color.
7) To enhance the black stripes' visibility, black nail polish is applied over the turquoise, further emphasizing the stripe pattern and adding depth to the overall design.
8) Finally, a clear top coat is applied to seal the design and add shine, protecting the intricate work and ensuring the durability of the striped nail art.
