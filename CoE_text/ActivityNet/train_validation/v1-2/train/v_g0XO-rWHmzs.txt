1) The woman in a red sweater and black pants is walking two white, fluffy dogs of the same breed on leashes, causing her to be actively engaged in guiding or controlling their movements.
2) Because she is holding the leashes in her right hand and the dogs are wearing harnesses, it enables her to manage the dogs' behavior and ensure their safety while outdoors.
3) The woman stopping to let one of the dogs sniff something on the ground indicates her attentiveness to the dogs' needs and interests, which is part of her active involvement in their walk.
