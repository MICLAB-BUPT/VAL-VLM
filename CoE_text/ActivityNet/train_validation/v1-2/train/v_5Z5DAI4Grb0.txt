1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'Online Art Classes' and 'Dry Brushing in Watercolors' along with the website 'www.artapprenticeonline.com', which introduces the content of the tutorial.
2) This causes the scene to transition to a woman, identified as Neadeen Masters, who is holding two paintbrushes and preparing to demonstrate the painting technique.
3) Neadeen Masters then starts by sketching the outline of the subject (apples and leaves) on a white canvas, laying the foundation for the watercolor painting.
4) After sketching, she uses various shades of red, green, and yellow paint to fill in the details, creating depth and texture, and this action showcases her skill and attention to detail.
5) The camera captures close-ups of her hands painting, blending colors, and adding details to the petals and leaves, which allows viewers to see the dry brushing technique in watercolors being applied.
6) Throughout the demonstration, the video also shows a palette with different shades of paint and a watercolor brush being dipped into the paint, providing a comprehensive view of the process.
7) Finally, the video ends with a black-and-white image of Neadeen Masters, thanking viewers for watching and mentioning future art classes, which concludes the instructional session.
