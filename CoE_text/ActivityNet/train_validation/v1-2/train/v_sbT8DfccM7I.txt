1) The man is standing outdoors next to a picnic table, which causes the setting to be established as a dry, open area with sparse vegetation and a clear sky.
2) The man, wearing a green shirt, helmet, and blue gloves, is holding a bicycle wheel, which indicates he is preparing to demonstrate a process.
3) He begins to manipulate the wheel, which causes him to start demonstrating how to fix a flat tire on a tubeless tire.
4) The use of his hands to manipulate the wheel and other components, along with the tool (possibly a pump or a tire repair kit), causes the actual process of fixing the flat tire to occur.
