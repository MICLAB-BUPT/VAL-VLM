1) The man pulls out a green electric lawnmower from a shed, which is the starting point of his lawn mowing activity.
2) He then begins to mow the lawn in front of a two-story brick house with white trim and a red front door, causing the grass to be cut evenly as he moves methodically across the lawn.
3) The lawn, already green and well-maintained, becomes freshly cut, indicating the recent maintenance caused by the man's actions.
4) After ensuring all areas of the yard are covered, he finishes mowing, leading to the lawn being neatly trimmed.
5) Finally, he returns the lawnmower to the shed and walks away, concluding the routine domestic task.
