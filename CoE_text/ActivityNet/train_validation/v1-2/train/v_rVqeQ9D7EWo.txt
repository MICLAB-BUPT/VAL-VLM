1) The man is dressed in winter clothing, including a hat and jacket, to protect himself from the cold weather.
2) The cold weather causes the man to use a red-handled shovel to clear the snow in front of the RV.
3) To effectively clear the snow, the man demonstrates various shoveling techniques, such as using a downward chopping motion to break up hard snow and lifting and throwing the snow to the side.
4) The effort required for shoveling causes the man to pause occasionally to adjust his stance or take a break.
5) After clearing the snow, the man stands next to the RV, possibly to explain something related to the shoveling process or the RV itself, with a snowy landscape and trees in the background.
