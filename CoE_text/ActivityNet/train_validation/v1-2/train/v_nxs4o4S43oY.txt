2) He starts by using an electric razor to trim his beard, which causes the beard to be at a more manageable length for a closer shave.
3) After trimming, he applies shaving cream, which is intended to soften the hair and protect the skin, making it easier and more comfortable to shave.
4) Then, he uses a razor to shave the lower part of his face, then moves on to shaving his neck and upper lip, with the aim of removing all trimmed facial hair.
