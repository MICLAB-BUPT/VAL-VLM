1) The video features a man in a bathroom, wearing a white t-shirt, demonstrating how to style hair using a comb and gel.
2) He starts by combing his hair back, which causes the hair to be initially arranged in the desired direction.
3) Then, he applies gel from the top of his head downwards, ensuring even distribution, which causes the hair to stay in place and have a sleek appearance.
4) He uses his fingers to smooth down any flyaway hairs and styles the sides neatly, which results in a more polished and controlled hairstyle.
5) The man then uses a comb to create a sharp parting line and combs the hair back again for a polished look, causing the overall style to appear neat and well-defined.
6) He adjusts his hair with his hands, making sure it's neat and tidy, which ensures that the final result meets his standards of grooming.
7) Throughout the process, he looks into the mirror to check his progress, which allows him to make necessary adjustments and achieve the desired polished look.
