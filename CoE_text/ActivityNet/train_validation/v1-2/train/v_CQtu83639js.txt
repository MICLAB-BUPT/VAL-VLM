1) The video begins with a man riding an exercise bike in a dark room, wearing a green and white cycling jersey, which causes the viewer to focus on his activity.
2) As he continues to pedal steadily, maintaining a consistent pace, this action causes the vibrant, animated ocean scene with waves and marine life in the background to create an immersive environment for the workout.
3) The immersion caused by the combination of the man's steady pedaling and the engaging background leads to the appearance of text on the screen, providing contact information for SpinWorks, including a phone number, address, and website, to inform the viewers about the service.
4) Finally, after the display of information, the man stops pedaling and sits still, looking towards the camera, which concludes the sequence of actions presented in the video.
