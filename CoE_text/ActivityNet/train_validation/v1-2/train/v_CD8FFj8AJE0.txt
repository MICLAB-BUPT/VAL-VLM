1) The video begins with a man sitting in a chair, wearing a black shirt and glasses, surrounded by various objects.
2) The scene transitions to the same man standing next to another person who is shirtless and wearing jeans, indicating that the man in the black shirt is about to perform a task on the shirtless person.
3) The man in the black shirt, now identified as the tattoo artist, is seen applying something to the back of the shirtless person using a cloth, which is part of the preparation for the tattooing process.
4) The tattoo artist then uses a tattoo machine and other tools, while wearing gloves, to create a tattoo design on the back of the shirtless person, who stands still and appears relaxed and comfortable throughout the process.
5) The tattoo artist continues working, focusing on different areas of the back, ensuring the design is applied correctly and evenly.
6) After completing the tattoo, the artist wipes down the back of the shirtless person with a cloth to clean the area.
7) The tattoo artist picks up a piece of paper with a detailed drawing or design, places it on the back, and presses it down firmly, possibly to compare the final result with the initial design or to transfer the design before the tattooing began.
8) Finally, the shirtless person holds a mirror to examine their back, seemingly pleased with the result, causing the conclusion of the tattoo session.
