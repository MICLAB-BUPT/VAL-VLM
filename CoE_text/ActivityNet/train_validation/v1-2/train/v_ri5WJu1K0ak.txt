1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'DREADLOCKS AND CYBERPUNK!' in white font, which causes the viewer to anticipate a transformation or styling process.
2) This anticipation is then met as the scene transitions to a person with long, bright pink hair standing in a bathroom, setting the stage for the upcoming makeover.
3) The person starts by styling their hair into dreadlocks, using their hands to twist and separate sections of hair, causing a change in their hairstyle from loose to styled dreadlocks.
4) Following the dreadlock styling, they put on a black headband with cat ears and adjust it, enhancing their look with an accessory that complements their new hairstyle.
5) After styling their hair, the person proceeds to apply makeup, focusing on their eyes with eyeliner, eyeshadow, and mascara, which causes their appearance to become more defined and dramatic.
6) In another sequence, the same person is seen brushing back their hair and tying it up into a ponytail, indicating a different approach or step in their styling process, possibly for adding variety to their look.
7) They then add black and white extensions to their hair, further altering their hairstyle and contributing to a more diverse and unique appearance.
8) Finally, the application of lipstick completes the makeup, resulting in a full cyberpunk-inspired makeover that aligns with the initial theme introduced at the start of the video.
