1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the tutorial on repairing a puncture in a bicycle tyre, which causes the man to start inspecting the tyre.
2) Upon inspection, the man finds and removes a small object from the tyre, causing him to decide that a repair is necessary.
3) The need for repair causes the man to use various tools such as a pump, pliers, and a tube of glue, and he also removes the tube from the tyre.
4) After removing the tube, the man uses a tool to remove the puncture, which then leads him to apply a patch (using a tube of glue) to the punctured area.
5) Once the patch is applied, the man reinserts the tube back into the tyre, causing him to proceed with inflating the tyre using a pump.
6) The inflation of the tyre causes the man to ensure it is properly inflated and ready for a test ride.
7) To confirm the success of the repair, the man rides the bicycle down a street, indicating that the repair has been successful.
