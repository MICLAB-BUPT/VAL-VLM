1) The artist, wearing a white top and black pants, begins by sketching the outline of the birds with a pencil, which causes the basic structure of the painting to take shape.
2) She then uses various shades of blue paint to fill in the background, creating a gradient effect that gives depth to the artwork, which enhances the visual appeal and provides a vibrant backdrop for the birds.
3) As she progresses, she adds details to the birds using darker colors like black and brown, enhancing their features and making them stand out against the blue backdrop, which results in the birds becoming more defined and lifelike.
4) The artist's deliberate and focused movements as she refines the painting, adding final touches, cause the artwork to become more polished and complete.
5) The woman is seen using different brushes and techniques to achieve the desired look, and she occasionally steps back to assess her work before making further adjustments, which ensures the painting meets her artistic vision and standards.
6) The completed painting, a vibrant display of abstract birds set against a dynamic blue background, showcases the artist's skill and creativity, which is the final result of all the preceding actions.
