2) The scene transitions to a close-up of boiling water in a pot on the stove, which causes the preparation for cooking to commence.
3) A hand places uncooked yellow pasta into the boiling water, causing the pasta to start cooking.
4) The pasta is stirred and submerged as it cooks, ensuring even cooking throughout.
5) The pot is then covered with a glass lid, which helps to maintain the heat and speed up the cooking process.
6) Next, a hand holds a container filled with red sauce, which contains whole peeled tomatoes, indicating the next step in the recipe.
7) The scene shifts to a metal strainer being placed under running water, preparing for the draining process.
