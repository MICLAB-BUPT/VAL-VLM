1) The video shows a person getting their nose pierced in a piercing studio, where the individual is wearing glasses and a hoodie, with their hair tied back.
2) The person is seated, which causes the piercer, wearing gloves, to prepare and then carefully insert a needle through the person's nostril.
3) After the needle is inserted, it leads to the piercer placing a piece of jewelry into the newly created piercing hole.
4) Throughout the process, the person remains still and cooperative, allowing the piercer to work efficiently, which is facilitated by the bright lighting that highlights the details of the piercing process and the vibrant colors of the studio's decor.
