1) The video starts with a man sitting at a table, holding a sneaker and various cleaning supplies.
2) He pours water into a bowl, which causes him to have the liquid necessary for cleaning.
3) Using the poured water, he then uses a brush to scrub the sneaker, causing dirt and stains to be loosened from the surface of the sneaker.
4) Next, he wipes the sneaker with a cloth, which helps in removing the loosened dirt and excess water from the sneaker.
5) He applies a cleaning solution from a bottle labeled 'Jason Markk', which enhances the cleaning process by providing a deeper clean and possibly conditioning the material of the sneaker.
6) He then uses a blue microfiber cloth to wipe down the sneaker, ensuring it is clean, as the microfiber effectively captures and removes any remaining dirt or residue.
7) The person also uses a spray bottle and wipes to clean the sneaker thoroughly, further ensuring that all parts of the sneaker are cleaned and maintained.
8) The video ends with credits rolling over a plain background, signifying the completion of the demonstration on how to clean a sneaker.
