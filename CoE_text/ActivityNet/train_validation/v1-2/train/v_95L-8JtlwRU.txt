1) The video showcases a person, wearing a red shirt with 'CLEAN KICKS' printed on it, cleaning a pair of Nike Air Max 1 sneakers.
2) They begin the process by spraying the shoes with a cleaning solution, which causes the dirt and stains to become more manageable for removal.
3) The individual then uses a brush to scrub the soles, sides, and laces of the sneakers, focusing on the dirty areas, causing the loosened dirt and grime to be removed from the surface.
4) After scrubbing, they use a cloth to wipe down the shoes, which helps in further removing the remaining dirt and cleaning solution, leading to a visibly cleaner appearance.
5) The next step is placing the shoes in a black mesh bag, which protects the sneakers during the machine wash, preventing damage or tangling.
6) They put the bag into a washing machine and add detergent, which will cause the water and detergent to clean the shoes thoroughly during the wash cycle.
7) The video ends with a shot of the clean sneakers, indicating that the thorough cleaning process has successfully restored the sneakers to their original condition.
