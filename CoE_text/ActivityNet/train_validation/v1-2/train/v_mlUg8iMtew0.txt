1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'My blog: Oil Painting Medic' in white font, which transitions to another black screen with the text 'EXERCISE in mixing TONES' in white and gray fonts, set against a blue and gray gradient background.
2) This introduction leads into a close-up of an oil painting depicting a child's face, followed by a close-up of an onion on a green surface, setting the context for the upcoming demonstration.
3) A black screen appears with the text 'This essential oil painting technique informs on blending smooth tones', explaining the purpose of the video, which then lists the art materials needed.
4) After the materials are shown, the instruction 'Divide the primed paper into a grid of five' is given, causing the person to use a brush to apply diluted blue acrylic paint over a grid on a piece of paper.
5) Once the paint is dry, the person places white in the far right grid and dark blue in the far left, as instructed, initiating the process of creating a gradient.
6) The text 'Add a little dark blue to white & place next to the white segment' guides the person to add dark blue paint to the white section, resulting in a gradual change in color.
7) The process continues with the person applying more dark blue paint to the center segment and then to the darkest segment, further developing the gradient.
8) The instruction 'With a clean sable, pull a little white into the neighboring color to create a soft seam' causes the person to use a different brush to blend the colors smoothly, enhancing the seamless transition between shades.
9) The person continues to blend the colors, adding more paint and blending it in until they achieve the desired smooth gradient effect across the paper, completing the demonstration.
