1) The person removes the handlebar grip, which allows access to the brake lever and reservoir.
2) The removal of the handlebar grip causes the person to then unscrew the brake lever from the handlebar, providing further access for maintenance.
3) Unscrewing the brake lever enables the person to open the brake reservoir cap.
4) Opening the brake reservoir cap leads to the person slowly squeezing the brake lever, which releases air bubbles from the brake system.
5) Releasing the air bubbles ensures that the brake system will function properly, causing the person to refill the reservoir with DOT 4 brake fluid.
6) Refilling the reservoir with brake fluid, using a yellow bottle labeled 'DOT 4', is done to ensure the brake system has the correct level of fluid for proper operation.
7) After refilling, the person screws the cap back on to secure the brake fluid inside the reservoir.
8) Finally, reattaching the handlebar grip and brake lever, and testing the brake lever, ensures that the maintenance is complete and the brake functions properly.
