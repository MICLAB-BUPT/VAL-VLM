1) The man starts by running towards the high jump bar, which causes him to gain the necessary momentum for his leap.
2) He then leaps over the bar with his body fully extended and arms outstretched, causing him to successfully clear the initial height of 6'11 1/2 (2.11m).
3) After clearing the bar, he lands on the mat on his back, allowing for a safe conclusion to each attempt.
4) This action is repeated multiple times, with the man attempting and successfully clearing different heights, including 6'9 3/4 (2.06m), 6'11 1/2 (2.11m), and 7'1/2 (2.16m), demonstrating his consistent skill and athleticism in high jumping.
5) Finally, he attempts a jump at 8'3 1/4 (2.51m) using a springboard, but unfortunately knocks the bar off the supports, indicating that this height was beyond his current capability.
