The two answers provided describe different events, and thus, they cannot be logically chained together as a single event. However, if we were to interpret this as a scenario where the athlete participates in both hammer throw and shot put, a possible logical chain could be:

1) The male athlete, dressed in a white tank top and red shorts, begins with the hammer throw event, standing on a circular platform.
2) He swings the hammer around his body to build up momentum, which causes the hammer to gain the necessary speed for a powerful release.
3) The athlete then releases the hammer into the air, and it flies towards the field, with the camera capturing the action from various angles, including close-ups of the athlete's focused expression and the hammer's landing.
4) After completing the hammer throw, the same athlete prepares for the shot put event, moving to stand inside a circular area designated for shot put.
5) Holding the shot put ball close to his neck, the athlete initiates the throwing motion by rotating his body and swinging his arm, which generates the force needed to propel the shot put.
6) The release of the shot put ball sends it flying through the air, and the camera tracks its path until it lands on the field.
7) Finally, after the shot put throw, the athlete leaves the throwing circle, potentially contemplating his performance in both events.
