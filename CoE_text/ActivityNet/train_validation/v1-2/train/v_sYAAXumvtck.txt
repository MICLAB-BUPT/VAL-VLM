1) The video begins with a close-up of various nail care products laid out on a table, including a UV lamp, nail files, and bottles of gel polish.
2) A person's hands are shown holding a white nail file and filing their nails, which prepares the nails for the application of polish.
3) They then apply a clear base coat to their nails using a brush, which serves as a foundation and helps the gel polish adhere better.
4) The person places their hand under the UV lamp for curing, causing the base coat to harden and set.
5) After curing, they remove the hand from the lamp and apply a layer of pink gel polish, adding color to the nails.
6) This process is repeated until all nails are covered in pink gel polish, ensuring an even and vibrant color.
7) The person applies a clear top coat over the pink gel polish, which protects the manicure and gives it a glossy finish.
8) Finally, they use a bottle of 'ORLY GELFX 3-in-1 Cleanser' to clean up any excess gel polish around their nails, completing the manicure.
