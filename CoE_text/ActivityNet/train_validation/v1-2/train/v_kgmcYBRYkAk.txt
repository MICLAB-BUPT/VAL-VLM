1) A young child in a red outfit and blue cap is playing hopscotch on a white grid drawn on the ground, which causes the child to demonstrate coordination and balance as they hop through the squares.
2) The environment, either an indoor shopping area with various shops, plants, and people walking around or an outdoor shopping area with visible plants and decorations, provides a vibrant and lively setting for the activity, causing the colors, especially the red of the child's outfit, to stand out against the grey floor and white lines of the hopscotch grid.
3) The presence of other shoppers, some sitting on benches and others standing near stalls or shops, along with the well-lit or bright lighting, suggests a busy yet engaging atmosphere, which does not directly interact with the child but contributes to the overall scene where the child plays.
