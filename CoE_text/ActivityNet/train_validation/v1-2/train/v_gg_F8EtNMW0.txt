1) The setting is a well-lit indoor gym with yellow flooring and walls, which is designed for martial arts or boxing training, causing the environment to be conducive for physical activities.
2) Both individuals are dressed in appropriate attire and protective gear, such as gloves and shin guards, which enables them to engage safely in a sparring session.
3) The man in black pants and a dark blue top (or black shirt) holds pads, which causes the other man, who is wearing black shorts with white stripes and a black top, to practice by throwing punches and kicks at the pads.
4) The presence of various training equipment like punching bags and pads against the wall, along with the floor marked for different exercises, facilitates a comprehensive training session, allowing the two men to practice a range of martial arts techniques.
5) The bright lighting from overhead fluorescent lights, casting minimal shadows, and the reflection of their movements in the mirror, enhances visibility and allows both participants to clearly see and adjust their techniques.
