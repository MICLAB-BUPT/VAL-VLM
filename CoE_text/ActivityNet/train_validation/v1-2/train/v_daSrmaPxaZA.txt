1) The video starts with a title screen, causing the viewer to recognize the brand and the topic.
2) A woman appears seated at a table with necessary items, leading her to begin the demonstration on how to clean and polish black leather boots.
3) She holds up the olive oil bottle and picks up a gray cloth, which causes her to pour some olive oil onto the cloth.
4) Pouring olive oil onto the cloth leads her to wipe down one of the boots, focusing on the toe area, for cleaning purposes.
5) After cleaning the boot, she places it back on the table, resulting in her continuing to speak while gesturing towards the camera, likely explaining the process or offering tips.
6) Her actions of applying the oil and rubbing it into the leather ensure that the boots are cleaned thoroughly, causing the demonstration to be complete.
7) The video ends with the same magenta background and 'style' text as seen at the beginning, signaling the conclusion of the tutorial.
