1) The video begins with an introduction to the Vidal Sassoon VS3038PT hair roller set, highlighting its features such as 23mm barrel size and ceramic technology, which causes the viewer to understand the tools they will be using.
2) This introduction leads to a step-by-step tutorial, where the first step is preparing the hair by sectioning it, causing the stylist to have organized portions of hair for styling.
3) After sectioning, securing the hair with a super clip is done, allowing each section to be kept in place, which then enables the stylist to work on one section at a time without interference from other parts of the hair.
4) The secured sections are then styled using the hair rollers, causing the hair to be curled according to the design intended.
5) The process of curling is demonstrated in both color and black-and-white sequences, enhancing the clarity of the instructions, which helps the viewer to better follow along and replicate the steps.
6) In addition to the use of hair rollers, a curling iron is also used to further style the hair, adding more defined curls or waves, which contributes to achieving a professional-looking hairstyle.
