1) The video starts with a white background displaying the text 'eHow' in green letters, followed by 'UK' in red, which then transitions to a red background.
2) This transition causes the display of text explaining how to play minor chords on a violin.
3) As a result, a woman is shown playing the violin, demonstrating the notes for G minor and D minor chords, holding the violin and bow, and moving the bow across the strings to produce sound.
4) Consequently, the video includes close-up shots of the violin's strings and finger placement, as well as wider shots of the woman playing, along with text instructions appearing throughout the video, guiding viewers through the process.
5) Finally, the video ends with a blue background displaying the 'eHow' logo again.
