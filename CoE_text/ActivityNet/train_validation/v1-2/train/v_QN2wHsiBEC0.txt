1) The man in a red shirt and patterned tie stands in front of a chalkboard with musical notes, holding a saxophone, which causes him to appear as if he is giving a lesson or presentation about the saxophone.
2) Because he is in a classroom setting, the man gestures with his hands and points at the chalkboard while speaking, leading to an engaging and interactive demonstration.
3) As part of the lesson, he demonstrates playing the saxophone by moving his fingers over the keys and blowing into the mouthpiece, which results in providing practical examples to his explanation.
4) To further illustrate his points, the man writes additional musical notes on the chalkboard, causing the visual aids to support his verbal and instrumental demonstrations.
