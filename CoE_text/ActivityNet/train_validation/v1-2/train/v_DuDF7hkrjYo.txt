1) A woman in a black sweater and blue jeans is standing in a living room, talking to the camera, which causes her to begin a demonstration on how to clean a wooden table.
2) She picks up the spray bottle and shows it to the camera before placing it back on the table, causing her to then pick up the brush and start cleaning the coffee table with it.
3) After brushing, she picks up the roll of paper towels and sprays the table with the spray bottle, leading her to use the paper towels to wipe down the table, moving them back and forth across the surface.
4) The action of wiping down the table with the cleaning solution leads her to the next step where she picks up the bottle of olive oil and pours some onto a paper towel.
5) Pouring the olive oil onto the paper towel results in her using the paper towel to apply the oil to the table's surface, causing the table to become shiny and smooth.
