1) The young boy, wearing a blue jacket and black pants, starts playing hopscotch on a driveway.
2) The hopscotch grid, which is drawn in chalk on the pavement with numbers from 1 to 8, causes the boy to follow the rules of the game by hopping through the grid, landing on one foot or two feet in each square.
3) As the boy plays, he bends down to pick up a rock from one of the squares, an action that is part of the traditional hopscotch game.
4) The enjoyment and engagement in the game cause the boy to smile and laugh as he hops through the grid.
5) After completing the course, his sense of accomplishment and fun from the activity cause him to turn around and walk back towards the camera with a smile on his face.
