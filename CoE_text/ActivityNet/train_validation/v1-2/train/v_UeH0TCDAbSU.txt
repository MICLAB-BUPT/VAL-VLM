1) A woman stands behind an ironing board with a blue shirt laid out on it, wearing a black long-sleeve top and jeans. On the right side of the ironing board, there's a can of spray starch and an iron, and the background consists of a brown curtain and a white wall.
2) The woman begins by spraying the shirt with the starch, which causes the fabric to become damp and more pliable, making it easier to remove wrinkles.
3) She then uses the iron, moving it back and forth over the shirt while pressing down firmly, which causes the heat and weight of the iron to smooth out the wrinkles in the fabric.
4) After ironing one section, she lifts the shirt and repositions it on the ironing board to iron another area, ensuring that all parts of the shirt are wrinkle-free.
5) Finally, after ironing, she lifts the shirt to inspect her work, showing satisfaction with the results, indicating that the process has successfully smoothed out all the wrinkles.
