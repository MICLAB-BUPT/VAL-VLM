1) The video begins with a person in a kitchen preparing a sandwich, which causes them to open a loaf of bread and place slices on a countertop.
2) After placing the bread, they open a jar of Miracle Whip, which leads to scooping out some of the spread and spreading it evenly on the bread slices.
3) With the spread applied, they take a package of cheese, causing them to slice it into thin pieces, which are then placed on top of the bread with the spread.
4) Next, taking a package of salami (deli meat) results in slicing it thinly, and these slices are added to the sandwich.
5) Finally, the action of placing another slice of bread on top completes the sandwich assembly.
