1) The video features a woman with long hair, wearing a white blouse and red lipstick.
2) She is smoking a cigarette in front of a red wall, which causes her to light the cigarette with a lighter.
3) After lighting, she takes puffs from the cigarette, causing her to exhale smoke.
4) There is a poster with an image of a woman in the background, which does not directly cause any action but provides the setting.
5) Throughout the video, she occasionally looks at the camera, adjusts her hair, and gestures with her hands while holding the cigarette, which are actions that occur as she smokes.
6) The presence of a flower in her hair (from Answer 2) suggests she has decorated herself, which may be a cause for her occasional adjustments to her appearance.
