1) The video starts with a woman in a pink top and white cap standing against a brick wall, speaking to the camera.
2) This causes her to move to a table where she demonstrates cleaning running shoes using a toothbrush and baking soda.
3) She scrubs the shoes with the toothbrush dipped in baking soda, focusing on the dirty areas, which leads to her rinsing the shoes under running water, ensuring all baking soda is washed off.
4) After rinsing, she places the cleaned shoes back on the table, showing them from different angles to highlight their cleanliness.
5) Then, she picks up one shoe and begins to demonstrate how to insert the insole into the shoe, carefully aligning the insole with the shoe's interior and pressing it down firmly.
6) This action prompts her to pick up a bottle of cleaning solution and pour some onto the insole.
7) Consequently, she uses a toothbrush to scrub the insole thoroughly, after which she rinses the insole under running water.
8) Finally, she places both shoes on the table and adjusts the laces, ensuring they are properly aligned.
