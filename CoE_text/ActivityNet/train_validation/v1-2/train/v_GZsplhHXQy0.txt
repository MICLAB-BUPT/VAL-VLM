The two answers describe different events, one is a discus throw and the other is a hammer throw. Since they cannot be logically integrated into a single event, I will provide the logical chain for each event separately:

Discus Throw:
1) The male athlete, dressed in a white shirt with red and blue stripes on the sleeves, green shorts, and white shoes, prepares to throw a discus.
2) He stands inside a designated circular area surrounded by a protective net, holding the discus in his right hand.
3) The athlete starts rotating his body and swinging his left arm to build momentum, which causes an increase in the speed of his rotation.
4) As he spins, he gradually increases the force, causing the release of the discus into the air.

Hammer Throw:
1) The man, who is performing a hammer throw, begins by swinging the hammer around his body.
2) Gradually, he increases the speed and momentum of the swing, which causes a buildup of force and energy.
3) His fluid and controlled movements demonstrate his skill and athleticism, leading to the eventual release of the hammer into the air.
