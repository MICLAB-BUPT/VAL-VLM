1) The video begins with a person preparing to create a stick and poke tattoo, which causes them to gather necessary materials such as a pencil, needle, lighter, rubbing alcohol, cotton ball, and lid.
2) After gathering the materials, the person sterilizes the needle using rubbing alcohol, which is done to ensure safety and prevent infection, then they wrap thread around it.
3) They secure the needle onto the pencil and wrap additional thread around the pencil's end, causing the creation of a makeshift tool for the tattooing process.
4) The person cleans their arm (or leg, based on the second answer) with rubbing alcohol, leading to a clean surface, and then draws a design on it, setting the stage for the tattoo application.
5) The dipping of the needle into ink and beginning to poke the design into their skin results in the gradual appearance of the tattoo.
6) Wiping away excess ink with a cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol follows, ensuring that the area remains clean and the tattoo design becomes more visible.
7) Finally, applying a bit of antiseptic and covering the tattoo with saran wrap for about 4 hours leads to the initial healing phase, after which cleaning it off with mild soap completes the immediate aftercare process.
