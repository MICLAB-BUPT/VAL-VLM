2) As the balloon continues to expand, it reaches an enormous size, almost covering the man's entire torso.
3) The man then carefully places the inflated balloon over the head of another person, who is lying on the floor with their legs raised and feet resting against a wall, causing the balloon to expand further and fit snugly over the person's head.
