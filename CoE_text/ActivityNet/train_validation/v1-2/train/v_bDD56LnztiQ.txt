1) The video starts with a green and white logo animation for 'eHow,' which causes the introduction of a man in a red shirt standing behind a table with two wooden blocks.
2) The man's appearance behind the table, where he seems to be speaking, likely providing information or instructions related to skateboarding, leads to the transition of the scene to an outdoor skate park.
3) At the outdoor skate park, the man performs various skateboarding tricks, including jumping over a rail and executing a trick on a ramp, which showcases his skills by landing smoothly after each trick.
4) The alternation between the indoor setting, where the man is speaking, and the outdoor scenes, where he is demonstrating different skateboarding techniques, emphasizes his expertise in the sport.
