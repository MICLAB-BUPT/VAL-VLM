1) The video begins with a view of a wooden door in a room with wooden paneling.
2) A person wearing a purple robe and having long, reddish-brown hair tied up in a bun enters the frame and stands facing the door.
3) The person removes their hair tie, letting their hair down to reveal its full length, which causes her to run her hands through her hair, brushing it out and letting it fall down her back.
4) She proceeds to brush her hair, starting from the top and working her way down to the ends, ensuring it is smooth and tangle-free.
5) After brushing, she gathers her hair into a ponytail at the back of her head.
6) The person then adjusts her robe and hair, ensuring everything is neat.
7) Finally, she turns away from the door, leaving the frame, and the video concludes with an empty view of the door and surrounding area.
