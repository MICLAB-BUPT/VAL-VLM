1) The video begins with a close-up of a person's hands holding a can of Dr. AirWair Martens Wonder Balsam shoe polish, with the text 'Dr. AirWair Martens' visible on the can.
2) A pair of black leather boots is placed on a tiled floor, and the scene transitions to show the text 'After', indicating that the boots have been cleaned and are now shiny, which is the intended result after using the balm.
3) A dirty boot is then shown, with the text 'State before to clean', signifying the condition of the boots prior to the cleaning process.
4) The person starts the cleaning process by scrubbing the boots with a brush, which causes the dirt to be removed from the surface of the boots.
5) Next, the person opens the can of shoe polish and applies it to the boot using a cloth, being careful to not put too much, ensuring an even application.
6) The person rubs the balm into the leather thoroughly, causing the leather to absorb the balm and become conditioned.
7) After applying the balm, they wipe down the boots with a clean cloth to remove any excess polish, which results in a clean, shiny finish.
8) Finally, the person closes the can, and the text 'Thanks for watching this video' and 'See you next time' appear, concluding the video and expressing gratitude for the viewers' attention.
