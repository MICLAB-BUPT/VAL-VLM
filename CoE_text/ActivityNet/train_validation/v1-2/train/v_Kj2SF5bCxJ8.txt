1) A young boy wearing a black T-shirt with green text and a clover logo is making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a kitchen, which causes him to start by spreading peanut butter on two slices of white bread using a butter knife.
2) After spreading the peanut butter, he adds jelly to one slice, then carefully spreads the jelly evenly across the bread, ensuring it covers the entire surface, which leads to the preparation being almost complete.
3) The completion of spreading both the peanut butter and jelly causes him to place the two slices of bread together, forming the sandwich.
4) Once the sandwich is formed, he takes a bite of the sandwich, which results in him enjoying his homemade treat.
