1) The video starts with a young boy in a black outfit holding a tennis racket and ball, standing on an indoor court, which causes him to begin practicing his serve by tossing the ball up and hitting it against the wall.
2) The scene then shifts to show the boy playing tennis with an older man, also dressed in black, who is presumably his coach, causing them to engage in a rally, hitting the ball back and forth across the court.
3) The coach demonstrates various techniques and movements, leading the boy to follow along, attempting to mimic them, thereby showcasing their skills and enjoying the activity together.
