1) The video begins with a man in an orange shirt and cap, who introduces himself as Han, a horseback riding coach, standing in an indoor equestrian arena and explaining that horseback riding is a full-body workout.
2) This introduction causes the scene to transition to a woman in black riding gear and helmet, preparing to ride a brown horse, which leads to her mounting the horse with assistance from Han.
3) After mounting, Han's guidance on basic riding techniques causes the woman to practice her skills by riding around the arena under his supervision.
4) The woman's focus and determination, along with the well-lit environment and sandy floor, contribute to her learning process, causing her to attempt to ride the horse while showing her progress.
5) Throughout the session, the instructor, Han, provides instructions on posture and balance, which leads to the woman engaging in conversation with him and walking alongside the horse, holding its reins, as part of her learning experience.
6) The combination of the instructor's guidance and the woman's practice ultimately causes her to confidently ride the horse independently, showcasing her progress by the end of the video.
