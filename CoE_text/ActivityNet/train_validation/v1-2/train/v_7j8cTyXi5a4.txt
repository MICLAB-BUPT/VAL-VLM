1) The video starts with a title screen, introducing the content and setting the stage for the instructional segment.
2) This introduction causes the woman to appear on screen, standing behind a table that has all the necessary items (black boots, gray cloth, and a white bottle labeled 'Oil') for the demonstration, establishing the context of the tutorial.
3) The woman begins by explaining the process, which leads her to demonstrate how to apply oil using the cloth, indicating the start of the practical part of the tutorial.
4) She pours some oil onto the cloth, causing her to then apply it to the boots in circular motions, focusing on different areas such as the heel and the toe to ensure even coverage, showing the step-by-step method.
5) The act of applying the oil and rubbing it into the leather results in the boots being thoroughly cleaned, highlighting the effectiveness of the technique.
6) After completing the application, she sets the boots aside, leading her to provide additional tips or concluding remarks about the boot care process, thus wrapping up the instructional content.
