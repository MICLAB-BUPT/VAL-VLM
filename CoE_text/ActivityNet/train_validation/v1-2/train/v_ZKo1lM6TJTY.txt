1) The video shows a man in a green and white uniform standing inside a netted area, holding a hammer.
2) He begins to swing the hammer around his body, gradually increasing the speed of the rotations, which causes him to build momentum with each turn.
3) The man is focused on his movements, maintaining balance and control as he spins, which allows him to maintain a steady rhythm.
4) After several rotations, the built-up momentum from the spinning causes him to release the hammer, which then flies out of the netted area.
