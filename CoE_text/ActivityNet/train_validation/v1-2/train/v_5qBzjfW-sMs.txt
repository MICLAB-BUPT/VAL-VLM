1) A person, wearing casual clothing including jeans, a dark jacket, and sneakers, is in a wooded area, which appears to be a backyard or campsite, during daylight. The environment includes trees, a wooden structure, and some outdoor furniture.
2) The individual is attempting to split wood with an axe that has a yellow handle, using a tree stump as leverage by standing on it and placing the wood atop another stump. 
3) The man swings the axe down onto the log placed on the chopping block, causing the wood to split after several attempts.
4) Successfully splitting the wood causes him to celebrate by raising his arms in triumph.
5) The lighting, suggesting it's either morning or late afternoon due to the long shadows cast by the trees, indicates the time of day when this event occurs.
