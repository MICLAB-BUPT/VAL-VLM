1) The video begins with a woman sitting on a brown leather couch, holding a curling iron and wearing a gray t-shirt with the text 'I'M NOT A LESBIAN BUT MY GIRLFRIEND IS' in black letters. She has red hair styled in curls.
2) The scene transitions to a black screen with white text that reads 'sorry about the bad lighting!!!', which causes the next black screen to appear with red text stating 'Beautiful curls like this using a curling iron that is turned into a curling wand???...'.
3) This leads to the woman taking a selfie in a bathroom mirror, wearing a pink hoodie over her gray t-shirt, and the background includes a white wall and a door.
4) The video then cuts back to the woman sitting on the couch, now facing away from the camera, working on her laptop, which causes a person wearing a blue and white striped shirt to enter the frame from the right side, holding a curling iron.
5) The person carefully wraps sections of the woman's hair around the curling iron, ensuring each curl is well-formed, while the woman remains focused on her laptop.
6) The video concludes with a black screen displaying red text that reads 'HOPE YOU ALL ENJOYED!!!!! MWAAHHH'.
