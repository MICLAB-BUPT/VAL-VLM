1) The video begins in a professional spa or salon setting, indicated by the clean white surface and the use of specialized waxing tools, which sets the stage for a detailed waxing procedure.
2) A gloved hand applies a green-colored wax onto a person's leg using a spatula-like tool, spreading it evenly across the skin, because this application is necessary to adhere to the hair and facilitate its removal.
3) A white strip is then placed over the waxed area and smoothed down, causing the wax to set and grip the hair firmly, which is essential for effective hair removal.
4) The strip is quickly pulled off, removing the hair from the leg and revealing smooth, hair-free skin underneath, as the rapid removal is key to minimizing discomfort and ensuring all hair is removed.
5) This process is repeated multiple times on different parts of the legs, emphasizing the thoroughness and precision of the waxing technique, to ensure that all areas are treated and to achieve a uniformly smooth result.
