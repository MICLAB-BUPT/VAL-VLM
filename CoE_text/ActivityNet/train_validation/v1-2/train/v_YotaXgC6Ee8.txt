1) The video shows a man practicing diving into a swimming pool from a springboard, which causes him to start by walking towards the diving board.
2) He is wearing blue swim trunks and no shirt, and the environment is an indoor swimming facility with clear blue water, white walls, and various diving platforms and equipment around the pool area, which sets the scene for his practice.
3) The lighting is bright, likely from overhead artificial sources, which illuminates the area, allowing for clear visibility of his actions.
4) The man performs multiple dives, each time entering the water with minimal splash, indicating good technique, and this is because he executes flips and twists before entering the water feet first, showcasing his fluid and controlled movements.
5) The sequence captures his movements from preparation to the dive and finally into the water, which results in the pool's surface rippling outwards from where he enters, creating concentric circles of disturbance in the water.
