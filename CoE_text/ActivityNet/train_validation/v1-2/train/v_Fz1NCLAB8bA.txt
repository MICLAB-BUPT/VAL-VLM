1) The man applies pre-shave oil to his face, which causes the skin to be better prepared and protected for the shaving process.
2) He then lathers up his face with shaving cream, causing a smooth surface that allows the razor to glide easily over the skin.
3) Using a straight razor, he shaves his beard, paying attention to detail and precision, which results in a close and clean shave.
4) Rinsing the razor under running water after each stroke ensures that it remains clean and effective, thus preventing any potential irritation or infection.
5) Finally, applying aftershave lotion soothes and moisturizes the skin, leading to a comfortable and refreshed feeling post-shave.
