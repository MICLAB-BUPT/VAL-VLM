2) The application of various nail polishes, including 'Fiji' by Essie, 'Tempest' by OPI, 'Sugar Plum' by Ciate Mini, 'Tart - Y' for the Party' by China Glaze, and 'Ferris Wheel' by Ciate Mini, causes the creation of a gradient effect on the nails.
3) Using a dotting tool to add small details and a brush to blend colors smoothly enhances the complexity and attractiveness of the design.
4) Applying a light pink nail polish to one of the nails using a brush, ensuring an even coat, is followed by the use of tweezers to apply small white dots onto the nail, which creates a starry effect.
5) Adding red zigzag strips to the nail further enhances the design's complexity.
6) The final step involves applying a clear top coat over the entire nail, which seals and protects the design, giving it a glossy finish.
