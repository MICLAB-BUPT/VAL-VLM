1) The woman, after taking a shower or bath, is standing in front of a mirror wearing a towel, which causes her to be in a state of preparing for the next part of her routine.
2) She begins by brushing her hair with her right hand while looking at herself in the mirror, an action that prepares her hair for styling and ensures there are no tangles, which leads to the next step.
3) After finishing with her hair, she pulls it back, which allows for a clear view of her face and prevents any interference with the makeup application process, causing her to move on to applying makeup.
4) With her hair out of the way, she uses her hands to apply makeup to her face, focusing intently on this task, which is the final observable step in her preparation routine.
