1) The man starts by removing the wheel from the bike, which is necessary to access the tire.
2) The tire is then deflated and removed from the rim, causing the tube to be accessible for inspection.
3) The puncture hole in the tire is located and marked, leading to the identification of the damaged area that needs repair.
4) The area around the hole is sanded, preparing the surface for better adhesion of the patch.
5) Glue is applied to the sanded area, causing the patch to adhere firmly when it is placed over the hole.
6) The patched tube is reinserted into the tire, which is then placed back onto the rim, allowing the tire to be reassembled.
7) The tire is inflated using an air pump, ensuring it is ready for use.
8) Finally, the wheel is reattached to the bike, completing the repair process.
