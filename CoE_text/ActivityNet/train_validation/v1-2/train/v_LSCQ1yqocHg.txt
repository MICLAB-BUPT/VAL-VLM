1) The video clip shows a person washing their hands in a kitchen sink, which is made of stainless steel and has two compartments.
2) Next to the sink, there is a soap dispenser filled with purple liquid soap, causing the person to have easy access to soap for handwashing.
3) The person turns on the faucet, causing water to flow, and applies soap from the dispenser, initiating the handwashing process.
4) They rub their hands together thoroughly, ensuring all surfaces are covered, which causes the soap to lather up and clean their hands effectively.
5) After rinsing off the soap under running water, they turn off the faucet, stopping the water flow.
6) Finally, they dry their hands with a towel, concluding the handwashing process.
