1) The video features a woman, presumably a waxing expert named Summer Valvasi, demonstrating the process of waxing legs.
2) She starts by applying a white substance to the legs, which causes the skin to be primed and ready for the waxing process.
3) Next, she pours a golden wax onto them, and using a wooden spatula, spreads the wax evenly across the skin, causing the wax to adhere to the hair.
4) Then, she places a white strip over the wax and presses it down firmly, causing the strip to stick to the wax and the hair beneath it.
5) Finally, she swiftly pulls off the strip, removing the hair from the leg in one smooth motion, caused by the strong grip of the wax on the hair.
