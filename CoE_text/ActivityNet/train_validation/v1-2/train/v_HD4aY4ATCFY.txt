1) The video begins with a close-up of the Cuban sandwich, showcasing its ingredients, which causes the viewer to understand the components of the dish.
2) This is followed by a person in a yellow shirt standing in front of a decorated wall, gesturing and speaking towards the camera, which sets the context and introduces the preparer.
3) The focus then shifts to the preparation process, starting with the spreading of mustard on bread slices, which is the first step in making the sandwich.
4) Adding pickles, cheese, ham, and shredded pork onto the mustard-spread bread is the next step, causing the formation of the sandwich's filling.
5) The sandwich is assembled by placing another slice of bread on top, which encloses the ingredients, preparing it for cooking.
6) Using a panini press to toast the assembled sandwich, pressing it down firmly, causes the cheese to melt and the bread to become crispy, enhancing the flavors and textures.
7) Finally, the sandwich is cut in half, revealing the layers inside, and served on a plate with garnishes like red pepper and pickles, which completes the presentation and readies the meal for consumption.
