1) The video shows a small brown dog being bathed by a person.
2) The dog is initially placed in a black plastic tub filled with water, where it appears to be enjoying the bath, causing the person to pour water over the dog's head and body using a blue bucket, ensuring the dog is thoroughly wet.
3) The dog is then moved out of the tub and placed on a wet concrete surface, which causes the person to use their hands to lather soap onto the dog's fur, focusing on different areas such as the back, sides, and legs.
4) After the soap is applied and the person scrubs the dog, they rinse off the soap using water from the bucket, making sure all the soap is washed away, leading to the final rinse.
5) The person uses a green hose to spray water over the dog, rinsing off any remaining soap and water, leaving the dog clean and dry, and finally, the dog is placed inside a metal cage, where it appears content and relaxed.
