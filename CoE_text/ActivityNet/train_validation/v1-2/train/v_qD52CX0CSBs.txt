1) The woman in a green tank top and blue jeans is standing next to a light brown horse, holding its reins, in an outdoor setting that resembles a ranch or farm, which causes the environment to include a fenced area with trees and a stable-like structure in the background.
2) She begins to pet the horse's neck and body, which causes the horse to respond by nuzzling her arm and leg affectionately, indicating that the horse is calm and receptive to her touch.
3) The clear daytime lighting and the horse's reaction to the woman's gentle petting suggest that she is either training or bonding with the horse.
