1) The video begins with a title screen that reads "Snow Shoveling 101" by Lucertius, dated December 25, 2013, in Grand Forks, North Dakota.
2) This causes the scene to transition to an outdoor setting where a person wearing a red jacket and blue jeans is shoveling snow on a sidewalk.
3) The individual's need to clear the snow leads them to use a black shovel to push the snow aside, methodically creating a path along the sidewalk.
4) As a result of their deliberate and focused actions, they make steady progress, clearing a significant portion of the snow.
5) The completion of this task results in the video concluding with a close-up shot of the snow, revealing the word "MERRY" written in it, indicating a festive or holiday theme.
