1) A young girl is playing hopscotch on a sidewalk.
2) The hopscotch grid is drawn in chalk on the concrete sidewalk, which causes the girl to follow the numbers as she plays.
3) She is wearing a purple jacket, black pants, and red shoes, which are suitable for her activity.
4) There is a bucket of chalk next to the grid, causing the girl to have easy access to more chalk if needed.
5) The girl hops through the grid, following the numbers, and this action leads her to bend down to pick up a piece of chalk from the bucket.
6) After picking up the chalk, she continues hopping, indicating that the retrieval of the chalk does not interrupt her game.
7) There is also a plastic cup on the ground near the end of the hopscotch grid, but it does not affect the girl's actions or the progression of her game.
