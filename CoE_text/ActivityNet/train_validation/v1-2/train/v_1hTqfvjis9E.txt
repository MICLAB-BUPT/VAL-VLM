1) The man, dressed in a blue and white athletic outfit, stands on a circular platform in an open field with green grass and trees, holding a hammer throw ball attached to a wire, which is the starting position for demonstrating or explaining the hammer throw technique.
2) This setup causes him to begin his demonstration by gesturing with his hands and moving the hammer around, indicating the steps and form of the technique.
3) His gestures and movements then lead to him performing the actual hammer throw, where he swings the ball in a circular motion several times to build momentum.
4) The built-up momentum from swinging the hammer causes him to release it into the air, completing the demonstration.
5) After the throw, the completion of the demonstration causes him to walk off the platform, leaving the empty field behind.
