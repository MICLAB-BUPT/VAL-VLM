1) The video begins with a title screen that reads 'How to Triple Jump' and then transitions to an outdoor track and field setting, which sets the stage for the instructional content.
2) A young boy in a yellow shirt and green shorts runs down the track, performing a triple jump into a sandpit, demonstrating the skill, and this demonstration is intended to provide a visual example of the technique.
3) After his jump, he exits the pit, and the man in the dark jacket walks towards him, possibly to offer feedback or instruction, which causes the boy to prepare for another attempt.
4) Text overlays providing instructions such as 'Start with a Run up,' 'Takeoff force you reach the mark,' and 'This is the Step' appear, guiding the viewer through the components of the triple jump, which helps the audience understand the key elements of the action.
5) The boy performs the triple jump again, incorporating the provided guidance, and the sequence from the run-up to landing in the sandpit with his feet together and then standing up and walking out of the pit, reinforces the instructional content by showing the complete process.
