1) The video shows a group of people preparing food outdoors, which causes them to use large bowls and baskets to hold various ingredients.
2) Among the group, a woman is peeling and slicing a vegetable, possibly a radish or daikon, using a peeler, which leads to her sitting on the ground with three basins in front of her.

4) The woman's focus and careful action of peeling and slicing the vegetable into thin strips contribute to the overall activity of the group, who are actively engaged in preparing food in a communal outdoor area.
