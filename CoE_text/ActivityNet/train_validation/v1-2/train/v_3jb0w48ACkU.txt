1) The man, wearing a blue jacket and gray pants, prepares to light a fire in a stone circle, which is the setting for the event.
2) He uses a long stick with a flame at the end, identified as a torch, to ignite the wood in the fire pit, causing the fire to start.
3) A woman, standing nearby and dressed in a purple shirt, records the event on her phone, capturing the process of the fire being lit.
4) The man continues to hold the torch over the flames and carefully moves it around the wood, ensuring the fire catches evenly, which causes the fire to spread and grow.
