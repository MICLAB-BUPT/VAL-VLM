1) A male weightlifter, wearing a black and white singlet, knee sleeves, and lifting shoes, is at a competition where the stage is branded with 'ROGUE' and 'Hookgrip' banners.
2) The weightlifter starts by gripping the barbell, which has red and green plates, with both hands, causing him to be in position for the clean and jerk lift.
3) He then lifts the barbell to his shoulders, performing the clean part of the lift, which causes the barbell to be positioned correctly for the next phase.
4) After securing the barbell at his shoulders, he pushes it overhead, executing the jerk, which is the final step in completing the clean and jerk lift.
5) The lighting focuses on the lifter, highlighting his movements, which causes the audience area to appear darker in comparison, emphasizing the performance.
