1) The video starts with a man sitting at a wooden table in a room with pink walls, talking and gesturing. He is wearing a blue denim shirt and glasses.
2) This causes the scene to transition to a close-up of a can labeled 'Paint Thinner' on the table.
3) Consequently, the man demonstrates how to use the paint thinner by pouring it onto a cloth and wiping the table surface.
4) While doing so, he continues to talk, which leads to him further demonstrating the cleaning process.
5) Afterward, he shows how to apply a substance from a yellow container onto a cloth and uses it to polish the table.
6) Finally, this results in the man standing up and walking away from the table, leaving the room.
