1) The athlete, dressed in a yellow and red uniform, prepares for the jumps, which causes him to focus and get ready for the physical exertion.
2) After preparation, the athlete runs with the pole, which allows him to gain the necessary speed to propel himself over the bar.
3) The running leads to the planting of the pole into the box, causing the pole to bend and store energy, which is essential for the jump.
4) As the pole bends, it releases its stored energy, propelling the athlete upwards and enabling him to attempt clearing the 4.70 meters bar.
5) The athlete's skill and technique cause him to successfully clear the bar multiple times, showcasing his athletic ability.
6) Upon each successful or unsuccessful attempt, the athlete lands on the blue mat, which provides a safe landing, allowing him to get up and prepare for the next jump.
7) The presence of spectators, officials, and other athletes in the background creates an atmosphere that can either motivate or pressure the athlete, influencing his performance.
