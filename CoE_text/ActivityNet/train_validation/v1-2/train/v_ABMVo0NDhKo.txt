1) A person in a white hoodie and jeans is standing on a sandy beach, holding a cup in one hand and a kite string handle in the other.
2) The person looks up at the sky where several kites are flying, which causes them to focus on controlling their own kite.
3) As they control the kite, they occasionally adjust the string, which is done to maintain or change the kite's flight path.
4) The person may also look around, possibly checking the wind direction or observing other kites, which helps them to better control their kite.
