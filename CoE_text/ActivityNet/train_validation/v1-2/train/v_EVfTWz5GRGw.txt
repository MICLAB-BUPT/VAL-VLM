3) After rinsing the gel off under running water, they use a toner from another bottle labeled 'ESKINOL PIMPLE FIGHTING REAL CLEANSER,' applying it to cotton pads and gently patting their face, which leads to the removal of any remaining impurities and the introduction of pimple-fighting ingredients such as salicylic acid and witch hazel.
4) Finally, they apply a skin calming concentrate from a golden bottle, massaging it into their skin for even absorption, which results in a soothed and nourished complexion.
