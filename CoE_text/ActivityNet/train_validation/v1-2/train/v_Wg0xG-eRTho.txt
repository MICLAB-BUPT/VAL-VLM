1) The video shows a person performing a leg routine, starting with applying lotion to their legs.
2) After the lotion is applied, in one scenario, they use wax strips and a waxing strip applicator to remove hair from their legs, rubbing the wax strips onto their legs and then quickly pulling them off, repeating this process several times on different areas of their legs, which causes the removal of hair and reveals smooth skin underneath.
3) In another scenario, after the lotion application, they proceed to shave their legs using a razor and shaving cream, which also results in the removal of hair. This action is followed by applying a wax strip to their legs and removing it, which further ensures any missed hairs are removed. Finally, they use a spray bottle to apply a product to their legs, possibly to soothe or moisturize the skin after the hair removal process.
