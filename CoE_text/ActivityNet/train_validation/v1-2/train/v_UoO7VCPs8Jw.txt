1) The video shows a man in a blue shirt and gray pants preparing to throw a shot put, which causes him to stand on a concrete platform with a grassy field behind him.
2) He starts by holding the shot put close to his neck with both hands, then begins to spin around, building momentum as he rotates, which leads to him completing the spin and releasing the shot put into the air with a powerful motion.
3) The shot put flies through the air and lands in the distance, while several people, some of whom are wearing jackets or hats, are watching him.
