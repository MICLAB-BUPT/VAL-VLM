1) The video features a woman standing behind a bar counter, preparing drinks.
2) She starts by pouring a clear liquid from a bottle labeled 'SMIRNOFF' into one of the two glasses filled with ice, causing the glass to contain a base of clear liquid.
3) Next, she adds a blue liquid from another bottle labeled 'Grey Goose' to the same glass, resulting in a mixture of clear and blue liquids.
4) Following this, she pours a pink liquid from a white bottle into the other glass, leading to the creation of a second, distinct drink.
5) Finally, she garnishes each drink with a slice of lemon on the rim and stirs the drinks with straws, completing the preparation process.
