1) A woman in a red cardigan and blue pants is seated on a brown leather couch, holding a spray bottle with a green cap. She's in a room with red walls, a window behind her, and decorative items on the windowsill. A book lies on the couch beside her.
2) The woman sprays the bottle onto a wooden table, which causes her to wipe it with a white cloth.
3) Wiping the table leads to the table becoming clean.
4) After wiping the table, she shows the clean surface to the camera, causing the demonstration of the product's effectiveness.
5) The video has text overlay at the bottom indicating she received a reward for reviewing the product, which suggests that her demonstration was part of a product review.
