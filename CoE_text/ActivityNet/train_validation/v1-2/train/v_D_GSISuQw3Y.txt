1) The video starts with a person sitting at a table, holding a bottle of nail polish and applying it to their nails.
2) They carefully paint each nail with red polish, ensuring even coverage, which causes the nails to have a uniform and neat appearance.
3) After finishing one hand, she moves on to the other, repeating the process, which leads to both hands being painted.
4) Once both hands are painted, she proudly displays them to the camera, showing off her freshly done nails, which then prompts her to interact with the camera, making playful gestures.
5) The person proceeds to display a sheet of colorful nail stickers, selecting one and placing it on her nail, enhancing the nail design beyond just the base color.
6) She applies a clear top coat over the nail art to seal and protect the design, causing the nail art to be more durable and long-lasting.
7) Throughout the video, in the background, there's a wooden dresser, a television displaying a show, and another individual briefly visible in the frame, adding context to the setting where the nail painting is taking place.
