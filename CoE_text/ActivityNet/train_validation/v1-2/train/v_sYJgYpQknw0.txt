4) The men switch to practicing with nunchucks, performing various moves and techniques, and are dressed in casual athletic wear, which results in the creation of a dramatic atmosphere due to the dim lighting in the indoor space with a wooden floor and a ping pong table serving as a makeshift barrier between them.
