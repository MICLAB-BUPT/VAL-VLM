1) The video clip takes place in an indoor swimming pool facility, likely during a practice session or training, which causes the environment to be well-lit with artificial lighting and to feature multiple diving boards at different heights.
2) A male diver, wearing dark swimwear, approaches the edge of the highest diving board, preparing for his dive, which leads to him jumping off the board.
3) As he jumps off the board, he executes a flip in mid-air, which results in him entering the water feet first, creating a splash.
