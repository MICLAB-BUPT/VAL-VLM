1) A toddler is standing in front of a bathroom sink, brushing her teeth. She is wearing a white diaper and has curly blonde hair with a bow on top.
2) The bathroom counter is cluttered with various items, including a pink bottle, a green toy, a yellow banana-shaped object, and a toothbrush, as well as a soap dispenser, a bottle of lotion, and a tube of toothpaste.
3) The toddler, who is using a pink toothbrush, is looking at herself in the mirror and brushing her teeth vigorously, indicating that she is focused on her task.
4) After thoroughly brushing, the action of needing to clean out her mouth causes her to lean over the sink to rinse.
5) The desire to dry her face after rinsing causes her to grab a brown towel from the counter and use it to dry her face.
