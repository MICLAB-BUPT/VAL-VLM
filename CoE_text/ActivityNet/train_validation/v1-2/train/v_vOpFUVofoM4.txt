1) The video begins with a title card that reads 'Coffee Break Music' and 'Soft Piano for Coffee Drinkers', which causes it to set the theme of the content.
2) It then transitions through several black screens with descriptive texts, each adding more information about the music, which leads to the audience understanding the purpose and availability of the music.
3) The absence of any human actions depicted in the video results in a focus solely on the text and imagery, which is designed to promote the music without visual distractions.
