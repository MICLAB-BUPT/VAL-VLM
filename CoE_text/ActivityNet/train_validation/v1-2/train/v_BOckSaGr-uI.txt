1) The artist, in a casual setting like his studio, prepares to paint by arranging an easel with a canvas and various painting supplies.
2) He discusses his approach to painting, emphasizing the importance of capturing the essence of the subject, the use of a reference image, and the significance of color and light in his work, which causes him to focus on the overall mood and atmosphere rather than just the details.
3) This discussion leads to the artist beginning to apply paint to the canvas, starting with broad strokes that suggest the form of a sailboat against a seascape background.
4) The act of referencing the image for inspiration while allowing his own artistic interpretation to take shape causes the artist to dip the brush into the palette and apply strokes to the canvas, creating the image of a sailboat on the water.
