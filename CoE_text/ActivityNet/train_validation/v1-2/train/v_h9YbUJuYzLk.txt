2) The stylist begins by combing through the woman's wet hair, sectioning it with clips, which causes the hair to be organized and ready for cutting.
3) He then cuts the hair using scissors, transforming the client's long, blonde hair into a shorter, layered style, specifically a sleek bob.
4) After the haircut, the stylist uses a blow dryer to style the client's hair, ensuring it is evenly styled and smooth, which results in a polished final look.
5) The salon environment, featuring wooden walls, mirrors, and various hair products, along with other clients waiting, provides a typical backdrop for the hairstyling process.
