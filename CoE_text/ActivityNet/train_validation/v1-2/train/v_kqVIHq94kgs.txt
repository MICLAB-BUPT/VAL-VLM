1) The video starts with a title screen introducing the topic of removing water marks from furniture, which causes the viewer to understand the context and purpose of the video.
2) A woman enters a room and reacts to a water mark on a table, causing her to gather the necessary materials including a rag, toothpaste, baking soda, a small bowl, mayonnaise, and furniture polish.
3) She mixes these ingredients in a bowl, which is then applied onto the water mark using a rag, causing the mixture to interact with the stain.
