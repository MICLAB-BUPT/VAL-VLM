1) The man, wearing a black tank top and grey pants with tattoos on his arms, starts to demonstrate how to tie a knot using a blue rope, which causes the woman, dressed in a white tank top and black pants, to stand beside him and observe attentively.
2) As the man begins by holding the rope in both hands and then proceeds to create a loop, it leads to him threading the end of the rope through the loop and pulling it tight, ensuring the woman understands each step.
3) The presence of a climbing wall with various holds and a yellow wall adorned with framed pictures in the background, along with the woman wearing a harness, indicates that they are in an indoor rock climbing gym, which sets the scene for the instructional demonstration.
