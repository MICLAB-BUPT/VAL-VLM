1) The video shows a woman and a girl trying to get a dog into a bathtub, which causes the dog, being large and resistant, to struggle against being bathed.
2) The struggle to hold the dog down in the tub causes the woman and girl to give up on bathing the dog inside.
3) Giving up on the indoor attempt, they take the dog outside to bathe it with a hose, but the dog remains uncooperative, causing further difficulty.
4) The continued uncooperativeness of the dog when using the hose leads the woman to use a booster bath, which makes it easier to bathe the dog, thereby saving their back, bathroom, and time.
