1) A woman with long, straight, red hair is seen in a bedroom setting, wearing a purple top and seated on a bed with blue sheets.
2) The room has white walls adorned with butterfly wall hangings and a tiger poster, providing the backdrop for her activity.
3) She begins by brushing her hair, using a blue comb to detangle it from the roots to the ends, ensuring it is smooth and tangle-free, which causes her hair to be ready for styling.
4) After detangling her hair, she then uses a blue hair straightener to style her hair, carefully running it through sections of her hair starting from the bottom and working her way up, which results in her hair becoming straighter and more styled.
5) Throughout the video, she occasionally looks at the camera while continuing to brush and straighten her hair, highlighting the focus on her hair care routine and the tools she uses.
