1) A person, specifically a woman, in a red coat and gray hat is playing the violin on a busy city street, causing her to be a noticeable figure among the pedestrians.
2) The woman is holding the violin with her left hand and the bow with her right hand, which causes the production of music as she moves the bow back and forth across the strings.
3) The environment being an urban setting with buildings lining the street and the presence of pedestrians walking by, some sitting on benches, and others standing or moving about, suggests that the woman's performance is taking place in a public, possibly bustling area, thereby attracting attention from passersby.
