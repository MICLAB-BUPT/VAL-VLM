2) This anticipation is followed by showing the ingredients and steps involved in making the sandwich, starting with spreading mustard on bread, which leads to the layering of cheese, corned beef, and sauerkraut.
3) After the ingredients are layered, another slice of bread is placed on top, and butter is spread on the outer slices, causing the sandwiches to be ready for toasting.
4) The application of butter and the use of a griddle to toast the sandwiches until they are golden brown result in the final product: a perfectly toasted Reuben sandwich.
5) Finally, cutting the sandwich in half reveals the layers of ingredients inside, completing the preparation process and showcasing the finished product.
