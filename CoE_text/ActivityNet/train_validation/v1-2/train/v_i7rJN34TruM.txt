1) The four players, divided into two teams, are engaged in a competitive yet friendly doubles match.
2) The match is played inside an enclosed court with wooden flooring and white walls, which causes the environment to be well-suited for the game.
3) The players wear athletic attire, with one team in white shirts and dark shorts, and the other in black shirts and lighter shorts, which allows for easy differentiation between the teams.
4) They use squash rackets to hit a small rubber ball against the front wall, causing the need for quick and agile movements as they position themselves to return the ball after it bounces off the walls.
5) The lighting is bright, likely from overhead fluorescent lights, casting minimal shadows on the floor, which enhances visibility during the game.
6) The environment, with no visible audience, focuses solely on the players' interaction with each other and the ball, leading to a concentrated and engaging game.
7) The video shows the players actively engaged in the game, hitting the ball against the wall and moving around the court to return it, which demonstrates their agility and coordination.
8) The court has glass walls, allowing for clear visibility of the game, which suggests that the sport being played is actually racquetball, not squash, as initially described.
