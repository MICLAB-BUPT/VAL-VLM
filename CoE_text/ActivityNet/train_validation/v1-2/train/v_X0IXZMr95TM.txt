1) The woman with blonde hair, wearing a black top, stands behind a bar counter in a cozy, well-lit bar setting, which is indicated by the shelves filled with various bottles of alcohol in the background.
2) She begins the cocktail preparation by pouring a clear liquid from a bottle into a martini glass, causing the base of the drink to be established.
3) Next, she pours the contents of the martini glass into a cocktail shaker, adding ingredients from different bottles, including a green and a red one, which leads to the mixture of the cocktail.
4) After sealing the shaker, she shakes it vigorously, causing the ingredients to blend thoroughly.
5) Finally, she strains the mixed drink from the shaker back into the martini glass, resulting in the completion of the 'Red Apple Martini With Lee' preparation, a pinkish-red cocktail that she then presents to the camera.
