1) The video begins with a man playing tennis in an indoor court, which causes him to use a tennis racket to hit a yellow tennis ball against the wall.
2) After playing tennis for several minutes, the scene changes, leading to the same man now playing racquetball, which results in him using a different type of ball, specifically a green, rubber ball, and continuing to hit it against the wall.
3) The transition from playing tennis to playing racquetball causes the man's activity to still be focused on hitting a ball against the wall, but with the variation in the type of ball and potentially the rules of the game he is engaging in.
