3) A person is then shown slicing and mincing garlic cloves and chopping parsley on a cutting board, preparing the key flavoring elements for the recipe.
4) Olive oil is poured into a measuring cup, and subsequently, the sliced garlic is added to a frying pan with olive oil, which causes the garlic to brown until golden, enhancing its flavor.
5) The heat is turned off, and the minced garlic is added to the pan, ensuring it does not burn but still contributes to the overall taste.
