1) The video features a small dog dressed in a pink dress, white hat, and sunglasses, walking on its hind legs, which is caused by a person holding the dog's front paws and guiding it.
2) The dog carries a red purse and walks confidently on a paved surface, an action that is made possible because the person is walking alongside, ensuring the dog maintains balance while moving.
3) The dog's movements are steady and deliberate, suggesting it is well-trained to walk like this, which is facilitated by the ongoing support and guidance from the person.
