1) The video begins with a man smoking a cigarette indoors, which is caused by him lighting the cigarette.
2) As he continues to smoke, he occasionally looks away from the camera, sometimes glancing down or to the side, while the background remains an indoor setting, specifically with pink walls.
3) The natural light from the window provides consistent illumination, allowing for close-up shots of his face as he smokes, exhales smoke, and maintains neutral facial expressions.
4) At one point, he puts on sunglasses while still holding the cigarette, but there is no significant change in his demeanor or actions during the video.
