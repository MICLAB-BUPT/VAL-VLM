1) The woman in a red tank top and black pants is demonstrating various exercises on a green and purple step platform, which causes her to perform movements such as stepping up and down, side steps, and arm movements while maintaining balance and coordination.
2) As part of the demonstration, the woman starts by stepping onto the platform with one foot and then steps down with the other foot, alternating feet, which leads to the repetition of this motion several times, thus demonstrating a step-up and step-down exercise routine.
