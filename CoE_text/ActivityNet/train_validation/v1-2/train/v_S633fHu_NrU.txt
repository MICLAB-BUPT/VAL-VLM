1) The video starts with a woman standing in front of a table outdoors, presenting various ingredients for a salad, which causes her to begin the demonstration by listing and pointing to each ingredient.
2) After presenting the ingredients, she begins preparing the salad, which leads to her chopping the chicken breast into small pieces and mixing it with the other ingredients in a large glass bowl.
3) She then adds the dressing, including olive oil, mayonnaise, and white wine vinegar (or mustard, olive oil, and vinegar as per the second answer), to the mixture, causing the ingredients to be thoroughly combined.
4) The thorough mixing of the ingredients results in the completion of the salad, leading to the final step where she presents the finished salad on a plate, which is placed on a red napkin on the table, ready to be enjoyed.
