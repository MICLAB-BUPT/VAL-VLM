1) The man in the workshop environment, wearing a white shirt and blue jeans, is initially seen sanding a wooden board on a workbench to prepare its surface.
2) After sanding, he uses a cloth to apply a substance, which is likely a wood finish or polish, onto the board, aiming to achieve a smooth and even surface with a dark brown color.
3) He then sands it with a sanding block again to further smooth out the surface, which causes the removal of any unevenness and contributes to achieving the polished look.
4) This process, including wiping off excess material and repeating the sanding steps, is conducted in a well-illuminated area surrounded by various tools and materials, such as a can of finish, rags, and other woodworking equipment, which support the completion of his task.
