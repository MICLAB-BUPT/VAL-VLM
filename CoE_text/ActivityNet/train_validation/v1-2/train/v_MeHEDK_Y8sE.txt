1) The video begins with a woman with long, blonde hair sitting against a white background, wearing a black tank top and having her hair styled in loose waves.
2) The scene transitions to a close-up of her hair as another person's hands appear, holding a section of her hair, which causes the demonstration of the curling process to begin.
3) The hands then wrap the section of hair around a curling iron, causing the hair to be curled. This step is repeated several times, showing the steps involved in curling the hair using the curling iron.
4) Alternatively, the woman also demonstrates how to curl her hair using a hair straightener, which leads to a different method of achieving curls.
5) She starts by taking a section of her hair and wrapping it around the straightener, causing the hair to start forming into a curl.
6) Then, she carefully rolls the hair around the straightener, ensuring it is tightly wrapped, which results in well-defined curls.
7) After that, she uses a piece of aluminum foil to cover the curled hair, pressing it down firmly, which further sets the curl.
8) Finally, she removes the foil and reveals the newly formed curls, causing the completion of the demonstration.
9) The video concludes with the woman showcasing her newly curled hair, which appears voluminous and well-defined, indicating the successful outcome of both methods.
