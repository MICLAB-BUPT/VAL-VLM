1) The video shows a woman washing clothes by hand in an outdoor setting, which causes her to use a large metal basin filled with water and soap.
2) She is scrubbing the clothes vigorously on the washboard, creating a lot of suds, which then leads her to wring out the clothes.
3) After wringing, she rinses them either in the basin or under running water from a nearby source, ensuring that each piece of clothing is thoroughly cleaned.
