1) A woman in a brown long-sleeve shirt is standing in a kitchen with white cabinets and countertops, demonstrating how to clean a brown leather shoe using various items on the counter, including a bottle of olive oil, a jar of shoe polish, a banana peel, and a white cloth.
2) The woman begins by wiping the shoe with the cloth, which causes the surface dirt and dust to be removed, preparing the shoe for further cleaning steps.
3) Then, she uses the banana peel to apply the shoe polish, an action that causes the natural oils in the banana peel to condition the leather while also helping to spread the polish more evenly.
4) She continues to wipe the shoe with the cloth after applying the banana peel, causing any excess polish or residue from the banana peel to be removed, ensuring the shoe's surface is smooth and even.
5) Next, she pours olive oil onto a cloth and applies it to the shoe, which causes the leather to become more supple and shiny due to the moisturizing properties of the oil.
6) Finally, she uses a brush to apply shoe polish to the shoe, causing the polish to penetrate the leather, enhancing its color and providing a protective layer against future wear and tear.
