1) The video features a windsurfer in action on a body of water, likely the sea or ocean, given the waves and horizon line, cause the environment is suitable for this activity.
2) The windsurfer is wearing a black wetsuit with red accents, which is similar to a black life jacket and red shorts, indicating that the attire is designed for both safety and visibility.
3) The windsurfer is maneuvering a board with a bright orange sail marked 'AKU 88', and he is holding the sail with both hands and leaning back to balance himself, demonstrating control and skill necessary for navigating through the waves.
4) The water is choppy with whitecaps, suggesting windy conditions ideal for windsurfing, which causes the windsurfer to move quickly across the water, creating splashes as he goes.
5) Other boats and windsurfers are visible in the background, indicating a recreational area where multiple people engage in water activities.
