1) The video shows a young man in a red and white tank top and black shorts preparing to throw a discus, which causes him to walk onto a concrete circle.
2) Walking onto the concrete circle leads to him spinning around to gain momentum, which then results in him throwing the discus with force.
3) After he throws the discus, the camera follows it as it flies through the air, causing it to land on the grass field marked with white lines.
4) The discus landing on the field prompts a man in a yellow shirt to retrieve the discus, while another person measures the distance of the throw.
5) The measurement of the throw and retrieval of the discus cause the athlete to walk back towards the starting point, where he is greeted by another person who congratulates him with a high-five.
