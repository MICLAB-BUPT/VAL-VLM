1) The woman standing behind the bar counter, dressed in a black top and with blonde hair, begins preparing a drink.
2) She pours tequila from a Jose Cuervo bottle into a glass filled with ice, which causes the base of the cocktail to be established.
3) Then, she adds a liquid from a white bottle to the tequila and ice, introducing another flavor or mixer to the cocktail.
4) The mixture is then transferred to a cocktail shaker, where it is shaken, causing the ingredients to blend and chill.
5) After shaking, the mixture is poured into another glass, resulting in a well-mixed and chilled cocktail.
6) Finally, she garnishes the drink with a slice of orange and places it on the counter, completing the preparation of the cocktail. 
7) In a different scenario, after pouring a clear liquid into a glass filled with ice cubes, she adds a yellow liquid, followed by a white liquid, causing the creation of a layered or mixed drink.
8) Squeezing a lemon over the glass introduces a citrus element to the drink, enhancing its flavor.
9) Placing a lemon slice on the rim of the glass as a garnish finishes the drink, making it visually appealing and ready for serving.
