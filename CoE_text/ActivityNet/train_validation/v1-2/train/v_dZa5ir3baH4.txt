1) The video shows an indoor sports facility with a long jump pit, where a person in a red shirt and black shorts is preparing for a long jump.
2) This person starts by standing at the beginning of the runway, which causes them to then take a few steps forward.
3) Taking a few steps forward leads to them bending down, initially appearing to touch the ground but actually adjusting their shoes, as a preparatory action before the jump.
4) After adjusting the shoes, the individual raises their arms above their head, which signals the start of the actual jumping process.
5) Raising their arms above their head then causes them to sprint towards the sandpit.
6) Sprinting towards the sandpit results in the person jumping into the sandpit, completing the long jump.
