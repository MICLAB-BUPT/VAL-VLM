1) A young boy, wearing a green shirt, gray shorts, and sandals, is playing with a yellow toy baseball bat and ball in a grassy yard.
2) The boy swings the bat at the ball, causing the ball to be hit into the air.
3) After hitting the ball, the boy chases after it, which leads to him retrieving the ball.
4) Upon retrieving the ball, the boy repeats the action of swinging the bat at the ball, thus continuing his play.
5) This sequence of actions (swinging, hitting, chasing, and retrieving) is happening in the front yard of a house, within a residential neighborhood that includes houses, trees, and a parked car.
