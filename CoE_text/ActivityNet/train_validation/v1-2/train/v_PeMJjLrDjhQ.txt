1) The video begins with a title screen that reads 'Washing Hands' on a black background, which causes the viewer to understand the subject of the demonstration.
2) It then transitions to a woman in a dark blue uniform standing in front of a sink, demonstrating the proper handwashing technique, which leads to her turning on the faucet and washing her hands thoroughly under running water.
3) She reaches for soap from a dispenser mounted on the wall and applies it to her hands, causing her to rub her hands together vigorously, ensuring all areas are cleaned.
4) After lathering the soap thoroughly and rinsing off the soap with water, she dries her hands using a paper towel, which leads to her using the same paper towel to turn off the faucet, preventing recontamination.
5) The scene shifts to a different room where the woman continues to demonstrate hand hygiene by using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer from a pump bottle placed on a table, which results in her dispensing the sanitizer onto her palm and rubbing it all over her hands, ensuring thorough coverage.
6) The video concludes with a black screen displaying the text 'WCC copyright 2008', indicating the end of the instructional content.
