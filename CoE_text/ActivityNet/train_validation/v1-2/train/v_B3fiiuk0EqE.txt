1) The man, wearing a red hat, black jacket, and blue jeans, is using a red and black snow blower with a long handle to clear the snow from his driveway.
2) The man pushes the snow blower forward, causing the machine to blow the snow off of the driveway and eject it to the side with each pass.
3) As a result, the driveway is partially cleared, revealing the concrete beneath the white snow, and the snow blower's cord trails behind it as the man works diligently.
