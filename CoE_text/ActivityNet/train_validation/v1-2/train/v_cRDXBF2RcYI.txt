1) The video shows a person lying on a table with their legs exposed, indicating the setting for a hair removal procedure.
2) A hand, presumably belonging to a professional, applies a white substance (likely wax) or a clear gel-like substance onto the skin of the legs using a wooden stick or spatula, which is the first step in preparing the area for hair removal.
3) The substance is spread evenly across the skin, ensuring that the entire targeted area is covered properly, which is essential for effective hair removal.
4) Then, a white strip of paper or cloth is placed over the waxed or gelled area and smoothed down, causing the strip to adhere firmly to the substance and the hair.
5) The strip is then quickly pulled off, removing hair from the leg due to the adhesive nature of the substance gripping the hair and pulling it out from the root.
6) This process is repeated several times, with the application of more substance, smoothing out strips, and pulling them off, to ensure all unwanted hair is removed, and the person's legs remain still throughout the procedure to facilitate the smooth execution of each step.
