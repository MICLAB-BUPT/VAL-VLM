5) In this part, the video shows a specific sailboat, which is white with a large sail, being maneuvered by two individuals wearing life jackets, who are actively adjusting the sails and steering the boat to maintain balance and speed in the face of the ocean waves, indicating that the boat is moving at a considerable speed.
6) Finally, the video concludes with credits rolling over a black background, acknowledging the contributors to the project.
