1) The video features a woman in a red shirt sitting at a table with nail polish bottles and a fake hand, intending to demonstrate nail painting techniques.
2) She starts by applying a clear base coat to the model hand's fingernail, which is done to prepare the surface and ensure the longevity of the nail polish.
3) After the base coat, she applies a red polish over the entire nail, and this step is repeated with a second coat of red polish for a more vibrant look, causing the color to be more vivid and appealing.
4) In another part of the demonstration, she adds white polish, likely to create a design or as an alternative to the red polish, showing versatility in her technique.
5) The process of carefully applying each layer of polish, ensuring even coverage, causes the final result to have a smooth application and glossy finish.
6) Finally, she applies a clear top coat to seal and enhance the color, which protects the nail polish and gives it a shiny appearance, completing the demonstration.
