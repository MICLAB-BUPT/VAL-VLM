1) A man in a blue shirt and khaki pants is demonstrating how to start a fire using a piece of wood and a lighter, which causes him to kneel on the ground next to a pile of rocks and a metal fire pit.
2) The presence of a black backpack and a wooden bench in the background suggests that he is prepared for an outdoor activity, which leads to him carefully placing the wood into the fire pit, ensuring it is positioned correctly for ignition.
3) After positioning the wood, he uses the lighter to ignite the wood, causing a small flame that gradually grows larger as he adds more wood.
4) The fact that the fire pit is surrounded by rocks provides a safe and contained area for the fire, which allows him to continue adding more wood, keeping it burning steadily.
