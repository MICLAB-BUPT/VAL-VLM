1) The video shows a woman standing behind a bar counter, preparing a cocktail.
2) She starts by pouring a clear liquid from a metal shaker into a glass (which in one version is already filled with ice, while in the other, she adds ice afterwards).
3) Then, she adds a brown liquid (or two different liquids, as per the second answer) from a bottle to the glass.
4) This combination of liquids and ice is then transferred to the shaker where she shakes the mixture, causing the ingredients to blend together.
5) After shaking, she pours the mixed drink into a martini glass.
6) Finally, she garnishes the drink (with either a red straw or a cherry, depending on the version) and presents it to the camera.
