1) The video features a woman in a stable, wearing a purple jacket and black gloves.
2) The stable has wooden walls, various saddles hanging, and a blue blanket on the ground, setting the scene for the activity.
3) She picks up a brown leather saddle, which causes her to show its underside to the viewers, likely to explain or demonstrate something about it.
4) She then proceeds to place the saddle onto the horse's back, causing her to adjust the saddle to ensure it fits properly.
5) Ensuring the fit of the saddle involves making sure the girth strap is tight but not too tight, which causes the woman to focus on the horse's comfort and safety.
6) After positioning and adjusting the saddle, she pats the horse gently, possibly to calm it down or show affection, which causes the horse to remain calm throughout the process.
