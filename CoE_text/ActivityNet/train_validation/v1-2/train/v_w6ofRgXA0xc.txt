1) The man, wearing a striped shirt, red shorts, and sandals, is in a backyard setting where he begins to prepare a fire.
2) He places various pieces of wood and paper into a large metal fire pit, arranging them for optimal ignition, which causes the setup to be ready for lighting.
3) To ensure the fire starts easily, he pours gasoline from a white jug over the wood inside the pit, covering all areas, which increases the flammability of the materials.
4) After pouring the gasoline, he adds a piece of paper to the pit and steps back, creating a safe distance before igniting the fire.
5) He lights a match and throws it into the pit, causing the paper to ignite, which then leads to the flames growing larger as the wood catches fire.
6) As a result, the man stands nearby, watching the fire burn, indicating that his preparation and actions have successfully started the fire.
