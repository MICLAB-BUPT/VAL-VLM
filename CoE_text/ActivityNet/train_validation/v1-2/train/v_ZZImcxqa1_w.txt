1) The video begins with a young man standing on a paved surface, holding a hammer throw implement, dressed in a white and red sports jersey, red shorts, and white sneakers.
2) The man starts to swing the hammer around his body, gradually increasing the speed of the rotation, which causes him to build momentum.
3) As he builds momentum, he spins faster and faster, eventually causing him to lose control of the hammer.
4) The loss of control causes the hammer to fly out of his hands and hit him in the head.
5) Being hit by the hammer causes the man to fall to the ground.
6) The video ends with a close-up shot of the paved surface where the man fell, followed by a logo animation for 'Jukin Video'.
