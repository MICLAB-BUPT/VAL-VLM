1) A woman in a black top or dress stands behind a bar counter, surrounded by various bottles of alcohol and fruits, suggesting a professional bar setting.
2) She picks up a bottle, which causes her to pour its contents, a clear liquid, into a glass filled with ice.
3) The addition of the clear liquid into the iced glass prompts her to pick up another bottle, from which she pours a dark liquid into the same glass.
4) After adding the dark liquid, she selects a third bottle, leading her to add a white (or possibly the third mentioned but unspecified color) liquid into the mixture.
5) Finally, the combination of the previous liquids in the glass motivates her to add a yellow (or orange, as per the second answer) liquid from a small container, completing the drink preparation process.
