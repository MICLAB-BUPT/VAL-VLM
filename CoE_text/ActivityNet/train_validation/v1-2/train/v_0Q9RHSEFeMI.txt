1) A group of people is engaged in a step aerobics class inside a well-lit, spacious room with wooden floors and large windows, which causes the environment to appear energetic and focused on fitness.
2) The participants, dressed in athletic wear, use black rectangular step platforms for their workout, leading them to perform synchronized movements to the rhythm of an unseen instructor's voice.
3) They step up and down from the platforms, alternating feet, and occasionally incorporate arm movements, which results in a lively and dynamic exercise routine.
