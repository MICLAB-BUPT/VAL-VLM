1) The video starts with a man sitting at a table, pointing to a damaged area on the table's surface, which is characterized by visible scratches and chips.
2) He then proceeds to apply a white substance to the damaged area using a marker-like tool, aiming to fill in and cover the imperfections.
3) To remove any excess material and ensure a smooth surface, he uses a black card to scrape off the surplus and further smooths it out with a green sponge.
4) The man continues to refine the repair by applying more of the substance if necessary and smoothing it out again, ensuring that the surface becomes even and well-finished.
5) After the surface is smoothed and even, he applies a clear substance over the repaired area for protection and uses a white cloth to wipe away any excess, finalizing the repair process.
6) Finally, he points to the repaired area, indicating the completion of the repair, showcasing the transformation from a visibly damaged surface to a restored one.
