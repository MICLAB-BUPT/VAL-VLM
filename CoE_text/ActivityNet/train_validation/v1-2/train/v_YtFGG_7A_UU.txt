1) A woman in a black dress is standing in front of a mirror, talking about shoe care, which causes her to start demonstrating the process.
2) She demonstrates how to clean and polish a black leather shoe using a white cloth and a tin of shoe polish, which leads to her holding up a small round tin of shoe polish and a white cloth.
3) The demonstration then proceeds with her applying the polish onto the shoe using the cloth, which results in her rubbing the polish into the shoe thoroughly, ensuring it covers all areas.
4) After applying the polish, she uses a brush to buff the shoe, making it shiny and polished, which allows her to show the difference between a polished and unpolished shoe.
5) Throughout the process, she explains each step and provides tips on shoe care, which emphasizes the importance of regular maintenance.
