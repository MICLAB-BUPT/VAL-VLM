1) The video shows a person in a black hoodie with a red logo and blue gloves working on a wooden table outdoors.
2) The person opens a jar, which is initially perceived as a stain but is actually peanut butter, and scoops some out with his hand.
3) He applies the peanut butter to the surface of the table, an action that replaces the initial description of applying a dark stain.
4) The man then uses a cloth to spread the peanut butter evenly across the table's surface, a step that mirrors the methodical approach described for achieving even coverage, but with a different substance.
