1) The barber uses clippers to trim the man's beard and hair around his ears and neck, causing the man to be prepared for a more detailed shaving process.
2) The barber applies shaving cream to the man's face, covering it completely, which causes the hair to soften and makes it easier for the razor to glide over the skin.
3) The barber proceeds to shave the man's face using a straight razor, carefully maneuvering around the man's nose and mouth area, which results in a close and precise shave.
4) After shaving, the barber wipes off the shaving cream and cleans the man's face, causing the removal of any excess cream and ensuring the face is clean.
5) Finally, the barber massages the man's face gently, likely applying some form of aftershave or moisturizer, which causes the man's skin to feel smooth and well-cared for.
