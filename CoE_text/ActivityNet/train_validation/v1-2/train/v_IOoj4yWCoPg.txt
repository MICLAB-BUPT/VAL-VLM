1) The woman's need to clean her clothes causes her to gather the necessary items for hand washing, such as buckets, a hose, and a large basin.
2) The availability of an outdoor space with a brick or concrete floor allows her to set up her laundry area in a backyard or patio, where she can freely use water without concern for indoor spills or mess.
3) The presence of the large basin filled with water and the black bucket enables her to have a system for both soapy and rinse water, which leads to the process of scrubbing and rinsing the clothes effectively.
4) The act of squatting or sitting on the ground provides her with a stable position to exert force while scrubbing, causing the dirt and stains to be removed from the clothes.
5) The action of wringing out the clothes after rinsing them in the basin removes excess water, which prepares the clothes for drying.
