1) The video shows a young woman in a school uniform, wearing a dark blue sweater, a plaid skirt, and black tights, brushing her teeth in a public restroom with white sinks and stalls and beige walls.
2) She is brushing her teeth vigorously, moving the toothbrush back and forth across her teeth, which causes her to maintain a focused expression while performing these actions.
3) After brushing, she rinses her mouth with water from one of the sinks and spits it out, which leads to her turning off the faucet.
4) Turning off the faucet then causes her to dry her hands on a paper towel.
5) Drying her hands results in her walking away from the sink and exiting the bathroom through a door.
