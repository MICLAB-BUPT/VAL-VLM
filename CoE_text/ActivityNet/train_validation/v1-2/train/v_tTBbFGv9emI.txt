1) The man in a blue tank top and jeans is preparing to chop wood, which causes him to position himself on a wooden block.
2) Standing on the wooden block, he swings the axe down onto the wood, causing the wood to split into smaller pieces.
3) As the man continues swinging the axe repeatedly, it results in more wood being split and an increase in the amount of sawdust and wood chips scattered around the ground.
4) The presence of white plastic bags and a pile of logs in the background suggests that this activity is part of a larger process of wood preparation, which is likely for use, possibly as firewood or for construction.
