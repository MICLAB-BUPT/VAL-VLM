1) The man and the child start mowing the lawn together, with the man pushing a yellow lawnmower and the child holding onto the handle, which causes them to work as a team.
2) The man, dressed in a blue shirt and shorts, is guiding the lawnmower, and this action causes the child to follow closely behind, learning how to use it.
3) Occasionally, the man stops to adjust the lawnmower or point out something on the ground, which causes the child to observe and understand the process of mowing the lawn.
