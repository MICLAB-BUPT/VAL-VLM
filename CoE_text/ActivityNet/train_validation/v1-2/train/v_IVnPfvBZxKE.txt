1) The video begins with a title screen, which causes the viewer to understand the content will be about making a sushi sandwich.
2) The transition to a kitchen setting with ingredients laid out on a wooden cutting board causes the preparer to have all necessary items at hand for the recipe.
3) The step-by-step instructions provided in the video cause the viewer to learn how to spread rice on the nori sheet and add salmon.
4) Adding salmon and other vegetables to the nori sheet, as shown in both answers, causes the creation of the filling for the sushi sandwich.
5) The process of folding the nori sheet and shaping it, whether into a square form or using a bamboo mat, causes the formation of the sushi sandwich or roll structure.
6) Covering the shaped sushi in bread crumbs and frying it in a pan until golden brown causes the exterior to become crispy and adds a contrasting texture to the dish.
7) Slicing the finished product, as demonstrated by both methods, causes the preparation of the sushi sandwich for serving.
8) The final shot of the sliced sushi sandwich and the encouragement to serve and enjoy the dish causes the completion of the instructional video, ready for viewers to replicate.
