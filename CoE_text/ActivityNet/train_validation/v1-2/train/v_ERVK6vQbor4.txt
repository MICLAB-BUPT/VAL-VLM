1) A man in a grey hoodie and black shorts is practicing boxing in an indoor gym, which causes him to wear black boxing gloves and throw punches at a heavy bag.
2) The heavy bag swings back and forth with each hit, causing the man to move around it and alternate between left and right hooks, occasionally switching to jabs.
3) The man's focused and deliberate movements as he practices his technique cause him to showcase his boxing skills.
