1) The video begins with a male gymnast in a gymnasium setting, preparing to perform on the parallel bars.
2) He starts his routine by swinging into a straddle position, which causes him to then execute three full swings before dismounting.
3) After the initial dismount, he transitions to performing a back swing that reaches at least a horizontal position, leading to a second dismount where he lands at a 45-degree angle.
4) As part of the routine, he holds a straddle V-sit or L-sit for two seconds, which is designed to earn a specified bonus, and this action is followed by another bonus-earning move: a handstand dismount without holding the position.
5) The completion of the performance leads to the appearance of credits, listing the director/editor, cameraman, and a disclaimer indicating that the video is an interpretation of the 'Code of Points' for Level 4 boys and is not sanctioned by the USA Gymnastics.
