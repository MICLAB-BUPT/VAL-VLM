4) Once the tattoo is completed, the scene shifts to show the man standing up, now wearing a black shirt and pants, conversing with another individual who has dark hair and a black shirt, indicating that the tattoo session has ended.
5) The man then gets up from the table and walks towards two other men standing nearby, where they engage in conversation while the woman observes them, suggesting a transition to a new interaction or topic.
