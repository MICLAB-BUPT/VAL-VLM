1) The video begins with a close-up of a pile of kindling and tinder placed on a bed of black soil, surrounded by grass.
2) A hand holding a package labeled 'Zippo' is shown, which contains a 'Campfire Starter' product, and the package is opened to reveal a round, brown object inside.
3) The hand then places the 'Campfire Starter' on top of the kindling and tinder, and introduces a small plastic bag labeled 'LINT', placing it next to the kindling.
4) The hand picks up a green lighter, igniting it to produce a flame, which is brought close to the kindling and tinder, attempting to ignite them.
5) After several attempts, the kindling catches fire, producing a small flame that gradually grows larger, causing the fire to burn steadily in the center of the black soil bed.
6) The person uses a stick to adjust the kindling, ensuring the fire catches properly, which contributes to the growth and stability of the fire.
