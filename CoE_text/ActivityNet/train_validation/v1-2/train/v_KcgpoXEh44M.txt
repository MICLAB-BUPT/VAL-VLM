3) Listing the materials (wrapping paper, scissors, tape, and the present) prompts the women to demonstrate the process of gift wrapping.
4) The woman in a black top holds the toy, and the woman in a striped top cuts the wrapping paper, which results in them folding and taping the paper around the toy.
