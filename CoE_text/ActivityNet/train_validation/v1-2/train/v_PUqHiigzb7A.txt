1) The video takes place in a gym setting, which is equipped with weightlifting equipment.
2) The man, wearing a white t-shirt, black shorts, and athletic shoes, begins his clean and jerk exercise by bending down to grip the barbell, causing him to lift it off the ground.
3) Lifting the barbell from the ground then causes him to transition into a squat position while holding the barbell at shoulder height, completing the 'clean' part of the exercise.
4) After standing up fully, he then pushes the barbell overhead with arms extended, which completes the 'jerk' part of the exercise.
5) In the background, another person is sitting on a bench, observing the lift, indicating an audience or support for the lifter.
6) The gym environment, including the presence of weight racks, benches, scattered weight plates, and motivational posters, provides the necessary setup and motivation for the exercise.
