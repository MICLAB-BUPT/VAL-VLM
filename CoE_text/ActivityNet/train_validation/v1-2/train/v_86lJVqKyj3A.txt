1) The woman places the box on a table, which causes her to have a stable surface to work on.
2) She cuts a piece of brown paper to cover the box, which allows her to prepare for the wrapping process.
3) She folds the paper neatly around the box, ensuring it is securely wrapped, which results in a neat and tidy appearance.
4) After wrapping, she tapes the paper down with clear tape, which secures the paper in place.
5) Finally, she ties a brown ribbon around the box, creating a neat bow on top, which adds a decorative element to the gift.
