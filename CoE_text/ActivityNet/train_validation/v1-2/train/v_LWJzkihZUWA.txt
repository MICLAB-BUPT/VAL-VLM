1) A young child, likely a toddler, is seated at a pink and purple toy vanity with a mirror, which causes her to be in a position to play with the items on the vanity.
2) The child, who is wearing a yellow sleeveless top, picks up a compact and a brush from the vanity, leading to her mimicking the action of applying makeup.
3) She brings the brush close to her face and then back to the compact, causing her to simulate the process of applying makeup while looking at herself in the mirror.
4) The setting, with its warm lighting and carpeted floor, suggests that the child is comfortable and engaged in this playful activity, which leads to her continued interaction with the makeup items.
