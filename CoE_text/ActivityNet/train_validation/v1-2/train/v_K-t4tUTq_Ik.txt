1) The setting is an indoor badminton court with wooden flooring and bright lighting, which causes the environment to be conducive for a competitive match.
2) Four players, dressed in casual sportswear (one team in white shirts and dark shorts, the other in light blue or darker shirts and shorts), are engaged in a doubles match, causing them to actively move around the court, lunging and stretching to hit the shuttlecock back and forth over the net.
3) The presence of large posters and a banner featuring badminton players and the slogan 'Stretch Your Potential' on the walls enhances the motivational and competitive atmosphere, further causing the players to focus on their swift movements and coordination.
4) The speed of the shuttlecock, making it barely visible, reflects the intensity and skill level of the game, thereby contributing to the lively and energetic environment.
