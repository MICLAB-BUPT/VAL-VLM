1) A person with long blonde hair, wearing a red top and black apron, is preparing fruit in the kitchen, which causes her to be engaged in cutting strawberries on a wooden cutting board.
2) The preparation of the fruit salad causes her to place the sliced strawberries into one of the two large bowls labeled 'PENNE FUSILI' that are filled with different fruits such as bananas, pineapple, and apples.
3) The kitchen environment, characterized by white cabinets, a window above the sink, and various kitchen items like a red kettle, a bottle of dish soap, and a bowl of grapes, facilitates her activity.
4) The natural daylight coming from the window provides sufficient lighting for her to focus on slicing the strawberries.
5) Her long blonde hair is tied back with a red bow, which prevents it from interfering with the food preparation.
