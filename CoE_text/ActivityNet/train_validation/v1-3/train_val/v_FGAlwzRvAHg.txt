1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'hi' in black and yellow letters on a white background, which transitions to another title screen with 'snowboarding' in black letters on a white background, followed by 'Transworld Snowboarding 20 Tricks' in red and blue letters on a light blue background.
2) The scene then shifts to a man standing behind a counter with a snowboard placed horizontally on it, causing the viewer to focus on the upcoming demonstration.
3) The man, wearing a green hoodie with a mountain logo and a cap, begins by holding the snowboard and explaining something while gesturing with his hands, leading to him picking up a blue iron.
4) He starts ironing the surface of the snowboard, moving it back and forth, which causes the wax to melt onto the snowboard's surface.
5) The man uses a blue sponge to apply and spread the melted wax evenly across the snowboard, ensuring thorough coverage.
6) He continues to iron the snowboard, ensuring the wax is evenly distributed, which leads to using a metal scraper to remove excess wax from the snowboard, scraping it off in small pieces.
7) Finally, he sprays a liquid onto the snowboard, causing the remaining wax to be more easily removed, and continues to scrape off the remaining wax, leaving the surface clean and smooth.
