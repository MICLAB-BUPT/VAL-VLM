1) The video starts with a bold red and white graphic title 'PUF NOTKASI' against a white background, which introduces the content.
2) It transitions to showing a bowl of ice cubes, setting up the environment for the potato preparation.
3) Then, water is poured over the ice, creating an icy water mixture, which is intended to be used for the potatoes.
4) A potato is placed in the icy water, causing it to chill and potentially making the skin easier to remove.
5) The chilled potato is then removed from the icy water, leading to the next step in the process.
6) Hands are used to peel the skin off the potato, resulting in a peeled potato.
7) The peeled potato is shown next to the bowl of water, indicating the completion of the peeling process.
8) Finally, the video returns to the initial graphic title 'PUF NOTKASI', concluding the demonstration.
