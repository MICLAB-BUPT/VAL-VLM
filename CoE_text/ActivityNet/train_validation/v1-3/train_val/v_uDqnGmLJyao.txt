1) The video features a woman with long brown hair wearing a black t-shirt, standing against a blue background.
2) She is seen speaking to the camera, likely providing instructions or information about wallpaper application, which causes the scene to transition to her applying a decorative border above window blinds in a room with beige walls and white trim.
3) To reach higher sections of the wall, she uses a ladder, and this enables her to carefully align the border along the wall's edge.
4) The video alternates between her speaking and demonstrating the wallpaper application process, emphasizing the ease of use and aesthetic appeal of the product, which leads to her cleaning the area with a cloth after applying the wallpaper.
