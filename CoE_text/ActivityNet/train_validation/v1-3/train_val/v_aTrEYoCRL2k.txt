1) The person starts by turning on the lawn tractor, which causes the machine to be ready for operation.
2) The operator then drives the lawn tractor over the grass, causing the leaves to be pushed and blown into a pile along the edge of the property.
3) As the tractor passes over the leaves, they are moved due to the action of the rear attachment, likely a leaf blower or mulcher, leading to the leaves being gathered efficiently.
4) The operator maneuvers the tractor in a methodical back and forth manner across the yard, which results in the systematic clearing of the leaves from the grassy area.
