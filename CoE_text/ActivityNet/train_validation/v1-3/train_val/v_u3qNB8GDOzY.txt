1) The video shows a person setting up a ladder with wooden planks attached to it, which is used for accessing the roof of a house. This setup causes the creation of a stable platform.
2) The person secures the wooden planks to the ladder using metal brackets and screws, causing the contraption to be more stable and safe for climbing.
3) They also attach a pulley system to the ladder, allowing the planks to be lifted or lowered as needed, which results in easier adjustment of the platform's height.
4) The person adjusts the position of the ladder and the planks multiple times throughout the video, ensuring that the setup is correctly aligned against the side of the brick house, leading to a safer and more effective access to the roof.
