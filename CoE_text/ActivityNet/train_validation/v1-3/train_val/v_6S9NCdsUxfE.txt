1) The man, dressed in a dark jacket and sunglasses, is in a snowy forest setting, holding two pairs of skis (one orange and one red), and appears to be demonstrating or explaining something about them, which sets the scene for an instructional video on skiing or ski maintenance.
2) This demonstration causes him to transition into a more specific task, where he is now seen wearing a blue jacket and black pants, indicating a change in his attire.
3) The change in attire is followed by the man's action of waxing climbing skins, using a tool to apply wax to a pair of orange climbing skins, which is a crucial step in preparing the skis for better performance in the snow.
4) After applying the wax, the man places the waxed skins onto the skis, ensuring they are properly aligned and secured, which is the final step in the process of preparing the skis, as demonstrated in the instructional video.
