2) From the squat position, he performs a series of arm movements, causing him to maintain his balance and form while staying low.
3) After the arm movements, he transitions into a wide-legged stance, which leads to him lifting one leg high in the air before returning to the squat, showcasing his flexibility and control.
4) His display of flexibility then causes him to move into a full split on the mat, further highlighting his agility.
5) Following the split, he demonstrates a specific squatting technique called 'Suru-ashi,' where sliding his feet in and out while staying low causes an emphasis on his lower body strength and technique.
6) Finally, his controlled and deliberate actions throughout the session cause him to stand up and perform a series of explosive movements, including jumping and squatting quickly, which showcases his overall strength and agility.
