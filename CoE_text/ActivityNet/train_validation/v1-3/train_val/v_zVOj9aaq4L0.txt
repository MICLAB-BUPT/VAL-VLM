1) The video begins with a woman applying a volumizing spray to her wet hair, which is the initial step to prepare her hair for styling.
2) This application of volumizing spray causes her hair to have more body and texture, making it easier to style and achieve the desired volume.
3) She then uses a hair dryer to rough dry her hair, lifting and separating sections with her fingers, which helps in removing excess moisture and starting to add some volume.
4) After rough drying, she sections her hair and uses a round brush along with the blow dryer to smooth and shape each section, causing her hair to be styled precisely and adding more volume at the roots.
5) The use of the round brush and blow dryer, with the nozzle pointed down and rolling the ends back up, results in a smooth and voluminous appearance.
6) She rolls sections of her hair into loose pin curls and secures them with bobby pins, which sets the style and enhances the curl formation.
7) Finally, she releases the pin curls and blends them with her hands, creating a soft, voluminous look, and uses a flat iron to smooth out any frizz, resulting in a polished and finished hairstyle.
