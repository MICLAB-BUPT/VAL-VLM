1) The video begins with a person boarding a train, holding a snowboard.
2) This causes the person to then board a cable car filled with other people, all dressed in winter gear and carrying snowboards or skis.
3) The cable car's ascent to a snowy mountain peak causes the person to disembark and start snowboarding down the slope, navigating through the snow and occasionally looking back at their shadow on the snow.
4) After this descent, the person boards another cable car, which takes them to a different location on the mountain, causing them to disembark and continue snowboarding through a wooded area.
5) Subsequently, the person boards a ski lift, which takes them to a higher point on the mountain, leading to another round of snowboarding.
6) The person's continued journey causes them to reach a snowy tunnel entrance, where they encounter and join another person who is also snowboarding.
7) Exiting the tunnel, the two individuals continue snowboarding on an open slope, passing by other skiers and snowboarders, until they eventually reach the bottom of the slope.
