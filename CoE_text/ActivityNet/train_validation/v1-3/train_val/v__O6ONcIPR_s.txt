1) The man, dressed in a black jacket and blue jeans, starts by holding the kite string in an open, grassy field.
2) He then runs across the field to generate enough lift for the kite, causing it to struggle to gain altitude.
3) As he runs, he loses balance, which causes him to fall to the ground; consequently, the kite also falls nearby.
4) Despite the initial setback, the man gets up and continues his attempts to fly the kite, but it keeps falling due to insufficient wind or improper maneuvering.
5) After several unsuccessful attempts, the man gives up, resulting in him sitting on the ground next to the fallen kite.
