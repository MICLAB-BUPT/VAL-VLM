1) The video features a person demonstrating how to apply Madshus powder on a racing ski, causing the viewer to learn the proper technique for this process.
2) The individual, wearing a black t-shirt and red sunglasses, starts by spreading the powder evenly over the gliding area of the ski using his hands, which causes the powder to be distributed uniformly across the surface.
3) Then, he uses an iron to melt the powder, ensuring it melts evenly across the ski's surface, causing the powder to integrate with the ski base and enhance its gliding properties.
