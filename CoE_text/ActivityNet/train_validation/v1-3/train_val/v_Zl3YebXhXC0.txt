2) The preparation causes the boy to start using the leaf blower, indicating he is ready to clear the leaves from the driveway.
3) The boy's action of moving the leaf blower back and forth and in different directions across the driveway causes the leaves to be gathered and blown away, effectively clearing the driveway.
4) The residential environment with visible trees, houses, and a garage, combined with the lighting suggesting it is either early morning or late afternoon, sets the scene where the boy performs this task.
