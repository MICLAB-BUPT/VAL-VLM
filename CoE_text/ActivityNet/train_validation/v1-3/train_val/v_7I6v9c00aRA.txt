1) The video features a person in a wetsuit attempting to wakeboard on a lake, holding onto a tow rope attached to a boat.
2) As the boat accelerates, it causes the person to be dragged through the water, creating a wake behind him.
3) The choppy water with white foam, indicating movement and speed, makes it difficult for the wakeboarder to maintain balance.
4) This difficulty in maintaining balance causes the wakeboarder to struggle while being pulled by the boat.
