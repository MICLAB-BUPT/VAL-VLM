1) The man is kiteboarding on a calm body of water, which could be a lake or ocean, and this activity is made possible because the weather conditions are favorable, as indicated by the clear blue sky.
2) He is dressed in a black wetsuit with red and white accents, along with black and white striped board shorts and a life vest, to ensure safety and comfort during the activity.
3) The man holds onto a control bar attached to a large kite, not visible in the frame but inferred from the lines he's holding, which causes him to be able to maneuver the kiteboard skillfully across the water's surface, creating splashes as he moves.
4) The video also shows two men standing side by side at a dock or marina, one wearing a black t-shirt with 'KiteHatteras.net' and the other holding a green kiteboard with 'CABRINHA' printed on it, suggesting that they are likely preparing for or have just finished a similar kiteboarding session.
