2) The central figure, dressed in a dark suit, is leading the performance, causing the other two players, who are dressed in black shirts, to follow his lead.
3) The warm and ambient lighting highlights the musicians and their instruments, which causes a visually appealing setting without harsh shadows.
4) The presence of a microphone stand in front of each player suggests that the event is either a recording or a live performance, causing the need for capturing the sound clearly.
5) The synchronized movements of the players as they create rhythmic beats on the drumheads cause a cohesive and harmonious musical output.
