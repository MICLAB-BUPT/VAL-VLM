1) The video starts with a man in an apron standing behind a table with various kitchen items, including knives and tomatoes.
2) He is demonstrating the use of an electric knife sharpener, which causes him to pick up the sharpener and place it on the table.
3) He then proceeds to sharpen each knife individually, which leads to testing the sharpness of the blade by cutting a tomato.
4) After successfully sharpening and testing the knife, he demonstrates the effectiveness of the sharpener by slicing the tomato into thin pieces.
5) Finally, the man picks up a booklet from the table and flips through its pages, possibly explaining the features or instructions related to the knife sharpener.
