1) The video showcases a step-by-step process of installing a PVC membrane on a flat roof, which causes the person to begin by using a yellow tool to mark the membrane's surface.
2) The marking of the surface causes the person to drill holes at the marked points with a power drill.
3) After drilling the holes, the person inserts metal fasteners into them and secures them with screws using the same drill, which leads to the next step.
4) The person then measures and marks the membrane for further installation, causing them to prepare for the application of adhesive.
5) Measuring and marking the surface also causes the person to clean it with a cloth, ensuring that it is free from any debris or dirt.
6) Cleaning the surface leads to the application of adhesive along the edges of the membrane.
7) The application of adhesive causes the person to use a heat gun to melt and fuse the material together, ensuring a seamless bond, and press down the membrane onto the surface, ensuring it adheres properly.
