1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'omelet' and 'Hotel XIV Toba. 2014-6-16', which then causes the scene to transition to a chef in a white uniform.
2) The chef, being seen in his uniform, starts the cooking process by pouring beaten eggs into a frying pan, which leads to him using a spatula to stir and fold the eggs as they cook.
3) As the chef continues to cook, he uses the spatula skillfully to ensure the eggs are evenly cooked and form a cohesive omelet, which results in the omelet being ready.
4) Once the omelet is ready, the chef's action of transferring it onto a white plate with a red rim completes the dish, leading to the end of the video.
