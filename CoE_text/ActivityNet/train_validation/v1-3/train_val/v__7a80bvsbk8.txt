1) The video begins with a wide shot of a bullfighting arena, where two matadors are standing in the center. The arena is surrounded by a large crowd of spectators. One of the matadors is wearing a red and white outfit, while the other is wearing a green and white outfit.
2) The matador in the red and white outfit approaches the bull, which is standing still in the center of the arena, causing him to perform a series of movements, including running around the bull and making gestures with his arms.
3) The bull remains stationary throughout this sequence, but then it suddenly charges at the matador in the red and white outfit, causing the man to run away from the bull.
4) The man runs towards a group of people who are also dressed in red shirts and white pants, seeking their help to evade the bull.
5) The group, along with the initial matador, attempts to subdue the bull together, surrounding it and beginning to wrestle it to the ground.
6) The bull resists at first, but eventually succumbs to their efforts, leading the matadors to tie up the bull and carry it out of the arena.
