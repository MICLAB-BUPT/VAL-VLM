1) The woman cuts the tops off orange bell peppers and scoops out the seeds and membranes, which prepares the peppers for carving and stuffing.
2) She carves triangular eyes, a nose, and a mouth into the peppers, causing them to resemble jack-o'-lanterns.
3) The preparation of a mixture consisting of ground beef, diced onions, garlic, mustard, croutons, diced tomatoes, an egg, salt, and pepper in a large bowl creates the filling for the stuffed peppers.
4) Spooning the mixture into the hollowed-out and carved peppers, followed by topping with shredded cheese, sets up the peppers for baking.
5) Baking the stuffed peppers at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes causes the ingredients to cook and the cheese to melt, resulting in a fully prepared dish.
6) The final display of the jack-o'-lantern stuffed peppers on a plate, ready to be served, is the outcome of all the previous steps.
