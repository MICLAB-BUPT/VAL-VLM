3) After the plastering is completed, the focus shifts to two people beginning the process of painting the ceiling with white paint using rollers attached to long poles, which is a direct consequence of the plastering being finished.
4) One of these individuals, a man in a white shirt and dark pants, is specifically highlighted as he works diligently, moving the roller back and forth across the ceiling, causing an even and thorough coverage of paint.
5) As the ceiling painting progresses, one person continues to paint the ceiling while the other moves on to painting the wall, indicating the natural progression from ceiling to walls in a room renovation.
