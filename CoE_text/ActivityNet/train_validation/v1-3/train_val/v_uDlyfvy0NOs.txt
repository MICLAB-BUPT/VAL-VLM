1) The video begins with a man standing in a parking lot, holding a tray of cookies. He is wearing a gray shirt and has short dark hair, with several cars parked in the background.
2) The man places the tray of cookies on the hood of a car, which is presumably hot due to the extreme heat, causing the cookies to bake using the heat from the car's hood.
3) After baking, the man takes the tray off the car and places it on a table, where he uses a spatula to spread out the now baked cookies on the tray.
4) The camera then cuts to a shot of the man walking through the parking lot, carrying the tray of freshly baked cookies.
5) He walks over to a car and places the tray on the hood, and the camera cuts back to the man, who is now standing in front of the car, smiling and looking at the camera while showing the cooked cookies.
