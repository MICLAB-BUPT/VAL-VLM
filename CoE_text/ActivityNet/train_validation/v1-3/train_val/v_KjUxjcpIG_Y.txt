1) A young boy in an orange shirt stands by a bathroom sink, holding a small cup. He appears to be preparing for a dental procedure, as suggested by the voice-over discussing the importance of rinsing and brushing teeth. The environment is a typical bathroom with white tiles, a mirror above the sink, and various toiletries around. The boy seems hesitant or uncomfortable about the upcoming activity.
2) This discomfort causes him to make faces as he attempts to rinse his mouth. An adult's hand briefly enters the frame, possibly offering assistance or reassurance, which leads to the boy being given a green bottle, likely containing medicine or a remedy for his discomfort.
3) After receiving the bottle, the boy drinks from the cup and then spits into the sink, continuing to show signs of discomfort or pain through his facial expressions. 
4) The boy then moves towards the sink again, where he is seen rinsing his mouth, still showing discomfort, before finally walking away from the sink.
