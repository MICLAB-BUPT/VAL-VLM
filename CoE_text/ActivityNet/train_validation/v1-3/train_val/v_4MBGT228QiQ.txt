1) In a well-equipped kitchen, two women stand behind a counter filled with various ingredients and utensils.
2) The woman on the left holds a book titled 'The Minnesota Table' and appears to be explaining something about it while gesturing with her hands, which causes the other woman, who is wearing an apron, to start preparing a drink based on the recipe or content from the book.
3) As a result, the woman on the right begins by squeezing lemon juice into a glass pitcher, then she adds honey, causing the mixture to combine, and subsequently stirs it.
4) After stirring, she adds ice and mint leaves to the pitcher, enhancing the flavor and cooling the drink, which indicates that they are following a specific recipe or method described in the book.
