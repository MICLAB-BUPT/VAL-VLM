1) A man in a light blue shirt and beige pants is trimming a tall, dense hedge using an electric hedge trimmer.
2) The hedge is situated along the side of a road with a gravel path beside it, and the surrounding area includes a grassy patch and some trees in the background.
3) It's a sunny day, casting shadows on the ground, and the man wears sunglasses to protect his eyes from the sun.
4) The man starts from the top of the hedge, moving downwards with precision to ensure even trimming, which causes the hedge to be shaped into a neat form.
5) He works methodically along the length of the hedge, focusing on his task.
