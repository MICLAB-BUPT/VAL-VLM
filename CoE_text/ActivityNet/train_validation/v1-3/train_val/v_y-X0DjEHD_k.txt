1) The man, wearing a red vest and white shirt, is standing behind an ice cream stand with a sign that reads 'K. MARAS DONDURMASI ICE CREAM', which indicates he is preparing to serve traditional Turkish ice cream.
2) The setting of the video changes from a small, enclosed space with walls lined with colorful fabrics or textiles, creating a cozy atmosphere, to an outdoor stall in a bustling street or market area, suggesting the man may have moved his operation or there are two different settings shown.
3) The warm lighting in both settings, whether it be from the enclosed space or the evening/nighttime glow of the outdoor stall, causes the environment to feel inviting and adds to the overall ambiance of the scene.
4) The man's use of a long-handled scoop to skillfully manipulate and serve the ice cream, along with his focused, precise, and swift movements, showcases his expertise and creates a playful and entertaining experience for the customers, which is a central focus of the video.
