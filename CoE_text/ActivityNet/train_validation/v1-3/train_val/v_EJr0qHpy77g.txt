1) The video shows a man in a gymnasium attempting to hit a pinata with a stick, and he is wearing a green shirt and blue jeans.
2) The pinata, which is red and white striped, is suspended from the ceiling by a string and being held by another person, causing it to be at an appropriate height for the man to try and hit.
3) The man swings the stick multiple times, trying to break the pinata, but he misses several times, which causes some anticipation among the other people in the background who are watching him.
4) Eventually, his repeated attempts cause him to make contact, leading to the breaking of the pinata.
