1) The video begins with a title screen that reads "Gliding Waxing Wooden Skis" by Liz Wagner, which causes the viewer to understand the topic and focus of the content.
2) It then transitions to a workshop setting where a person, wearing an apron, is seen working on wooden skis, indicating the start of the demonstration.
3) The individual uses a small container of wax and applies it to the surface of the skis using a cloth or sponge, causing the initial layer of wax to be deposited on the ski.
4) After applying the wax, the person uses a brush to spread the wax evenly across the surface of the ski, ensuring a uniform coating which enhances the gliding performance.
5) Finally, they use a cloth to wipe off any excess wax and ensure a smooth finish, resulting in properly maintained and waxed wooden skis ready for use.
