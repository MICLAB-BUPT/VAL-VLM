1) In a playground, two children are playing on swings, which causes one child to push the other child who is swinging with a small dog in a carrier.
2) The child pushing the swing, wearing a striped hoodie and jeans, causes the swing, along with the child in a pink jacket and blue pants and the dog, to move back and forth.
3) The dog in the carrier, a small, light-colored breed, appears to be enjoying the ride as it swings, caused by the continuous pushing from the child.
4) In the background, there are parked cars and a fence surrounding the playground area, which does not cause but provides context to the scene.
