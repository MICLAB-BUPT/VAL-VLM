1) The video begins with a close-up of the finished cake, then transitions to the initial stages where a round chocolate cake is placed on a glass plate.
2) The person starts by cutting strips from the edge of the cake and placing them around its circumference, which causes the cake to have a decorative border.
3) They cut open a red bag of Maltesers and pour the chocolates into a clear bowl, followed by adding M&M's and KitKat chocolates, preparing the ingredients for decoration.
4) The person proceeds to fill the cake's edge with Maltesers, M&M's, and KitKat chocolates, creating a vibrant and colorful border, which enhances the cake's visual appeal.
5) Using a spatula, they spread chocolate frosting over the top of the cake, ensuring an even layer, which causes the surface to be smooth and ready for additional decorations.
6) More M&M's, KitKat chocolates, and finally Maltesers are added to the center of the cake, arranged neatly, which results in a visually appealing and well-organized appearance.
7) A wooden skewer is inserted into the center of the cake, dipped into melted chocolate, and reinserted, which causes the skewer to be securely anchored and ready for the final touch.
8) Finally, they pour M&M's and KitKat chocolates onto the skewer, allowing them to cascade down the sides of the cake, completing the decoration process, which leads to a beautifully decorated and festive-looking cake. 
9) The cake is then placed in the freezer for 30 minutes, which causes the decorations to set and the cake to become firm, ensuring that the decorations stay in place.
