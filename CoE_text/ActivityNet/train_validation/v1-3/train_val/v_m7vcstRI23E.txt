1) A young girl in a kitchen, wearing a chef's hat and apron, is preparing to bake sugar cookies.
2) She begins by pouring ingredients into a green mixing bowl, including flour from a bag labeled 'Sugar Cookie Mix', a stick of butter, and an egg.
3) The addition of the ingredients causes her to use a spatula to mix them together thoroughly.
4) After mixing, she kneads the dough on the countertop, which results in shaping it into a ball.
5) Kneading the dough leads to her covering it with plastic wrap and placing it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to chill.
6) Once chilled, she rolls out the dough, which allows her to use cookie cutters to create various shapes.
7) Creating the shapes causes her to place the cut-out cookies onto a baking sheet.
8) Placing the cookies on the baking sheet prompts her to put them in the oven for about 9 minutes.
9) Baking the cookies for 9 minutes results in her taking the freshly baked cookies out of the oven.
10) Taking the cookies out of the oven leads to her showing them off to the camera, displaying them proudly.
