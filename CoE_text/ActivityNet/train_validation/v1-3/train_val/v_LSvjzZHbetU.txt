1) The video starts with a woman in a green sweater standing next to a wooden fence, explaining the process of painting it.
2) She then demonstrates how to prepare the area by laying out newspapers and masking tape, which is done to protect the surrounding areas from paint splatters.
3) Next, she shows how to mix the paint in a sprayer tank, preparing for an even application of paint on the fence.
4) The woman uses the sprayer to apply the paint evenly across the fence, ensuring a smooth and uniform finish.
5) Additionally, she applies brown paint using a brush, which might be for touch-ups or detailed work that the sprayer can't reach, wearing a white face mask for safety.
6) After painting, she removes the newspaper and masking tape from the fence, revealing the protected areas untouched by paint.
7) Finally, she cleans up the area, showing off the freshly painted fence and providing final tips on the painting process, thus completing the project.
