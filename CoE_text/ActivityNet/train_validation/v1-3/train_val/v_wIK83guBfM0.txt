1) The video shows a person carving a pumpkin on a table covered with newspapers, in an outdoor patio area.
2) The person starts by cutting off the top of the pumpkin, which causes the inside of the pumpkin to be accessible.
3) They then scoop out the seeds and pulp, causing the pumpkin to be hollowed out.
4) Next, they use a marker to draw a design on the pumpkin's surface, which guides where they will carve.
5) Finally, they carve out the design using a knife, resulting in a jack-o'-lantern with a spooky face.
