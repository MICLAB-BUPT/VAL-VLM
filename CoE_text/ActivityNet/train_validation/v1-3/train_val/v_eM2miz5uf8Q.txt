1) The video shows a man in a winter jacket and beanie standing next to a snow-covered car, which causes him to need to remove the ice from the car's windows.
2) He is using a scraper tool to carefully remove the ice from the car's windshield, making sure not to scratch the glass, which leads to the ice being cleared layer by layer.
3) After clearing the windshield, he then moves on to the side window, continuing to scrape the ice away, indicating his thoroughness in ensuring all windows are clear.
4) The background shows a snowy landscape with trees and houses visible in the distance, which suggests that the cold, wintry environment is the reason for the ice formation on the car.
