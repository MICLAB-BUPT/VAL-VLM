1) Two men are engaged in an arm wrestling match on the trunk of a silver car, both wearing black t-shirts, in a residential driveway during daylight with greenery and houses visible in the background.
2) The man on the left, who has sunglasses on his head, seems to be initially winning, as he is pushing the other man's arm down towards the ground. This causes the other man, who sports a red number '32' on his shirt, to exert significant effort, as indicated by their facial expressions and body language.
3) Despite the initial advantage of the man with sunglasses, the man with the number '32' overpowers him, which causes his hand to be slammed down onto the car.
4) The victory causes the man with the number '32' to celebrate by raising his free hand in triumph.
5) After the celebration, the victor walks away from the car, holding what seems like a bottle, while the loser stands against a wooden fence looking defeated.
