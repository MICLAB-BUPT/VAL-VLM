1) The groomer prepares the tools and products, including a brush, comb, spray bottle, and 'Purina Pro Plan' dog food, on a table, which is necessary to have everything ready for the grooming session.
2) The preparation of these tools causes the groomer to start the grooming process by brushing the dog's fur with the brush, which helps in the initial removal of loose fur and dirt.
3) After brushing, the use of a comb to detangle and smooth the fur is caused by the need to ensure that the dog's coat is free from knots and tangles.
4) The application of a grooming solution using a spray bottle is done to enhance the quality of the dog's coat, causing it to be more manageable and healthier-looking.
5) The continuous brushing and combing of the dog's fur, ensuring it is clean and well-groomed, is a result of the comprehensive approach taken by the groomer, who aims to maintain the dog's hygiene and appearance.
