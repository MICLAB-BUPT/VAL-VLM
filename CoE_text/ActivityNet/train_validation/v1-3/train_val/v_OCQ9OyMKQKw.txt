1) A man in a white shirt, beige pants, and a hat is standing in a garden holding a pair of pruning shears, and he appears to be explaining something about the plants around him. The garden has various green plants and trees, with a wooden fence visible in the background, and the lighting suggests it's daytime.
2) This explanation causes him to then demonstrate how to trim a bush using a hedge trimmer, where he makes precise cuts to shape it.
3) After trimming, because there is a larger branch that was not easily accessible with the hedge trimmer, he uses a chainsaw to cut it down.
