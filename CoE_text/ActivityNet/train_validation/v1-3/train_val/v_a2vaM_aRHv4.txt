1) The video begins with a title screen introducing 'Just One Cookbook' and the recipe for Castella, which causes the viewer to understand what will be demonstrated.
2) It transitions to showing the ingredients needed, including eggs, sugar, bread flour, warm water, honey, and parchment paper, causing the viewer to gather all necessary items before starting.
3) The process starts with preparing the parchment paper by marking the corners, cutting them off, and folding over the edges of the pan, which prepares the pan for the batter.
4) The honey mixture is prepared by whisking warm water and honey together, which creates a sweet liquid that will later be used in the cake.
5) Eggs are beaten in a stand mixer until light and fluffy, followed by adding sugar and beating on high speed for five minutes, which incorporates air into the mixture, making it voluminous and ensuring a light texture of the cake.
6) The honey mixture is then added to the egg mixture while continuing to beat, further enhancing the flavor and moisture of the cake.
7) Bread flour is sifted into the mixture, and the batter is poured into greased cake pans, which helps to incorporate the dry ingredients smoothly and prepare the batter for baking.
8) The batter is smoothed out with a spatula, and air bubbles are removed using a skewer, which ensures an even bake and prevents large holes in the cake.
9) The cakes are baked at 320F for 40-45 minutes, which causes the batter to set and transform into a fully cooked cake.
10) After baking, the cakes are brushed with the honey mixture, removed from the pans, and wrapped in plastic wrap, which adds extra sweetness and keeps the cake moist.
11) The cakes are chilled in the fridge, which sets the texture and makes it easier to slice.
12) Finally, the cakes are sliced into even pieces and served on plates, allowing for an aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable final product.
