1) The video starts with a woman standing in a kitchen, wearing a blue and white striped top. She is surrounded by various kitchen items like a jar of flour, a can of baking powder, and a mixing bowl.
2) The woman begins by explaining the process of making a cake mix from scratch, which causes her to start pouring flour from a large glass jar into a metal measuring cup.
3) After adding the flour, she adds baking powder from a yellow canister into the measuring cup, followed by sugar from a clear glass bowl, causing the combination of dry ingredients.
4) The woman then uses a metal sifter to sift the combined flour, baking powder, and sugar mixture into another glass bowl, which leads to a more refined and evenly mixed set of dry ingredients.
5) Holding up the glass bowl containing the sifted mixture, likely for explanation, she proceeds to add wet ingredients from a carton into the bowl, leading to the thorough mixing of all ingredients.
6) Finally, she presents the finished cake mix in a clear glass bowl, ready for use, as a result of her careful and methodical preparation.
