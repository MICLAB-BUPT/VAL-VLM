1) The video features a woman playing two conga drums, which causes her to be the central focus of the scene.
2) She is dressed in a black tank top, which, along with her fluid and controlled movements as she strikes the drumheads, causes an engaging and visually coherent performance.
3) The woman's seating arrangement, either on the floor or on a chair, causes a variation in the setup but does not affect the rhythmic beat she produces.
4) The use of her hands to rhythmically strike the drumheads, creating a steady and precise beat, causes the production of the musical performance.
5) The background, featuring a plain wall with a framed picture, and the soft lighting casting gentle shadows, causes a setting that emphasizes the woman and her playing, making the performance more visually appealing.
