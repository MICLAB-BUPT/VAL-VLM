1) The video showcases a person performing maintenance on a long, narrow object that appears to be a ski.
2) The individual starts by using a red and black device with a digital display to measure or scan the surface of the ski, which causes them to understand the condition of the ski's surface.
3) After assessing the ski, they proceed to apply a white substance, possibly wax or polish, along the length of the ski using a brush or applicator, which is intended to improve the ski's performance.
