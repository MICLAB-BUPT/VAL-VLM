1) The video begins with a man standing in front of a mirror, looking at his reflection.
2) He then proceeds to remove his contact lenses by pinching them out of his eyes and placing them into a small container, causing him to need an alternative for vision correction.
3) The man washes his hands thoroughly under running water from the sink, ensuring cleanliness before touching his glasses.
4) After washing his hands, he dries them with a towel, preparing to handle his glasses without leaving smudges or water marks.
5) He puts on a pair of glasses, providing the necessary vision correction after removing the contact lenses.
6) The video ends with the man looking at himself in the mirror again, seemingly satisfied with his appearance, indicating the completion of the transition from contact lenses to glasses. 
7) However, another part of the video shows a person performing the task of inserting contact lenses, which is a separate event, involving the individual handling the contact lens, placing it on their finger, and carefully inserting it into their eye, suggesting that this sequence demonstrates the process of wearing contact lenses, as opposed to the removal and replacement with glasses shown earlier.
