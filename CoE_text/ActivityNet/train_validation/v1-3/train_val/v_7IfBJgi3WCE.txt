1) The video begins with a view of two parked vehicles, a red pickup truck and a black SUV, on the side of a residential street. 
2) Then, the camera pans to show a person, who is wearing a white shirt and blue jeans, pushing a red lawn mower along the sidewalk.
3) This person maneuvers the lawn mower around a corner, passing by other parked cars and houses, which causes the scene to shift to a boy riding a red lawn mower on the grass next to the sidewalk.
4) The boy, who is now in control of the lawn mower, is wearing a baseball cap and jeans, indicating a change in the operator of the lawn mower.
5) With the lawn mower, which has a large cutting deck designed for residential use, the boy drives in a straight line, following the edge of the sidewalk, continuing the activity of mowing that was started by the first individual.
