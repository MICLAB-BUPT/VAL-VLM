1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'Sunday Morning with Audrey & Fay Fay' in white cursive font, which then transitions to a kitchen scene where two young girls, one in a dark blue top and pink skirt, and the other in a pink top and green apron, are preparing cookies.
2) The girl in the blue top opens the oven door, while the girl in the pink top stands on a chair holding a box of chocolate chip cookies, causing them to start mixing ingredients at a wooden table.
3) The girl in the blue top pours contents from the box into a large glass bowl and stirs it with a wooden spoon, leading the girl in the pink top to watch attentively.
4) The girl in the blue top kneels down to open the refrigerator, retrieves an item, and returns to the table to continue mixing, prompting both girls to stir the cookie mixture together, with the girl in the blue top using a wooden spoon and the girl in the pink top using a metal spoon.
5) Both girls sit down to continue stirring the mixture, with the girl in the blue top sitting on a white rocking chair, and the girl in the pink top sitting on a high chair, which causes the mixture to be thoroughly mixed.
6) The girls then stand at the wooden table, shaping the cookie dough onto a baking sheet, with the girl in the blue top placing the shaped dough onto the sheet, and the girl in the pink top assisting by placing more dough, resulting in a fully prepared baking sheet.
7) The girl in the blue top places the baking sheet into the oven, followed by the girl in the pink top, and they both watch the cookies bake through the oven window, leading to the completion of the baking process.
8) The girl in the blue top takes out the freshly baked cookies, causing them to both sit at the wooden table, enjoying their cookies with cups of tea, and the video ends with a black screen displaying the text 'Bon Appetit!' in white cursive font.
