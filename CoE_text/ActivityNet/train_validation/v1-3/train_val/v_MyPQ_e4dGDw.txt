2) The person then cuts the lemon in half, causing the lemon to be ready for juicing.
3) They squeeze the cut lemon into the glass, resulting in lemon juice being collected in the glass.
4) In one scenario, they scoop out some yeast from a jar and add it to the lemon juice, while in another, they add honey to the lemon juice, both actions aiming to enhance or alter the flavor.
5) The mixture is stirred thoroughly with a spoon, ensuring that the added ingredient (yeast or honey) is well combined with the lemon juice.
6) The person then pours the mixture into another glass, preparing it for the next step.
7) In one scenario, more water is added to the mixture, whereas in the other, ice cubes are added first, followed by water from a tap, both actions intended to dilute the mixture and make it suitable for drinking.
8) Finally, they stir the mixture again, making sure all ingredients are fully integrated, and place the glass on the counter, completing the preparation of the drink.
