1) The video showcases a DIY furniture painting tutorial, where a blue-painted dresser is being transformed into a white one.
2) The process begins with the woman sanding the furniture, which causes the surface to become smooth and ready for painting.
3) After sanding, she applies masking tape, which prevents paint from getting on certain parts of the dresser that need to be protected.
4) She then paints the dresser white using a brush and a roller, ensuring even coverage. This action transforms the color of the dresser from blue to white.
5) Once the first coat dries, she adds a second coat of paint, enhancing the coverage and giving a more uniform appearance.
6) After the paint is dry, she sands the edges of the dresser, which creates a distressed look, adding a stylistic touch to the piece.
7) Finally, she applies clear wax over the painted surface, causing the dresser to have a glossy finish, thus completing the transformation.
8) The final scene shows the completed white dresser with brass handles, contrasting with the original blue top, indicating the successful completion of the project.
