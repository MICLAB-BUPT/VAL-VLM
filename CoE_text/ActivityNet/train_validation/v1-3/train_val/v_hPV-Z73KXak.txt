1) The video features a man in a white shirt and black pants, wearing glasses, seated at a drum set, which causes him to be in a position to demonstrate various drumming techniques.
2) He uses drumsticks to play the drums and cymbals, including the snare drum and bass drum, which leads to the showcasing of different rhythms and beats, thereby demonstrating his precise and rhythmic movements as well as his drumming skills.
3) The setting of the room, with its red walls, bookshelves filled with books, and framed pictures adorning the wall, provides a background that enhances the visual appeal of the demonstration, and the bright lighting illuminates the entire scene, making it clear for viewers.
4) A microphone positioned near the drum set for recording purposes suggests that the session is being recorded, which implies the intention to either teach, share, or preserve the drumming performance.
