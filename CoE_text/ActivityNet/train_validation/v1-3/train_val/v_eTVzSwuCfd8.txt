1) The video features a young woman with long, dark hair demonstrating a blow-dry routine in front of a mirror, causing her to start by brushing her wet hair with a pink brush.
2) After brushing, she uses a leopard print hairdryer with a round brush attachment to dry and style her hair, which leads her to methodically section her hair, focusing on different areas like the top, sides, and back, ensuring even drying.
3) Her deliberate and precise movements as she works through each section, occasionally adjusting her hair to achieve the desired look, cause her to carefully dry each section of her hair, starting from the roots and working her way down to the ends.
4) Once her hair is dried, running her fingers through it to style it is the final step, completing the blow-dry routine.
