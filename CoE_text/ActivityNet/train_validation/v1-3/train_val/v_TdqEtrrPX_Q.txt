1) In an outdoor setting with a building and trees in the background, two individuals are lying on the ground surrounded by yellow frisbees. One person is wearing a red jacket and black shorts, while the other is dressed in camouflage pants and a black jacket.
2) The man in the red jacket, who is lying on his back on the ground, holds a yellow frisbee and throws it towards the dog, causing the dog to jump up and catch the frisbee mid-air.
3) After the dog successfully grabs the frisbee mid-air and lands back on the ground, the man in the red jacket sits up and continues to play with the dog, throwing the frisbee again and encouraging the dog to jump and catch it.
4) Throughout the activity, several other people stand around observing the interaction between the man and the dog.
