1) The woman, dressed in a black and white striped tank top and black shorts, is seated on a rowing machine in the gym, which causes her to be in the correct position to start her exercise.
2) She holds the handle with both hands, causing her to have a firm grip necessary for performing the rowing motions.
3) The woman begins to perform a series of rowing exercises by extending her legs and pulling the handle towards her chest, which causes the resistance mechanism of the rowing machine to engage, providing her with the workout.
4) After pulling the handle, she returns to the starting position, which causes her to complete one full cycle of the rowing motion.
5) The action of extending and pulling is repeated multiple times, causing her to build endurance and strength through the continuous rowing exercise.
