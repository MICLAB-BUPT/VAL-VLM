1) The video shows a young girl in a pink dress playing with a long stick and discs (or a ball) on a blue court.
2) She is seen running around the court, which causes her to interact with the discs by pushing them along the ground using the stick (or, in the case of the ball, holding the stick while interacting with the ball).
3) The court has white markings and numbers indicating different sections, which guide the structure of her play.
4) The enjoyment she experiences as she moves energetically across the court is a result of her active engagement with the stick and the objects (discs or ball).
