1) The video starts with a man, wearing a blue and black jacket, standing next to an open car trunk, holding a jack, a spare tire, and a wrench.
2) He is preparing for a tire change, which causes him to use the wrench to remove the lug nuts from the flat tire.
3) After removing the lug nuts, he uses the jack to lift the car slightly off the ground, allowing him to remove the flat tire.
4) The removal of the flat tire causes him to then place the spare tire onto the car's hub.
5) With the spare tire in position, he tightens the lug nuts on the spare tire using the wrench to secure it in place.
6) Once the tire is secured, he removes the jack and lowers the car back to the ground.
7) Finally, he places the jack and the now removed flat tire back into the trunk, closes it, and stands in front of the car, looking at the camera.
