1) The video begins with a woman bathing a black and white dog in a bathtub, using a hose to wet the dog, which causes the dog's fur to become thoroughly soaked.
2) After wetting the dog, she applies shampoo and scrubs it into its fur, causing the dirt and oils to be removed from the dog's coat.
3) She rinses off the shampoo, which leads to the removal of soap and suds from the dog's body.
4) The woman dries the dog with a towel, which results in the dog's fur becoming less wet and more manageable for grooming.
5) She brushes the dog's fur, which leads to the fur being smooth and free of tangles.
6) The woman holds the dog's paw and trims its nails with a pair of clippers, which prevents the dog's nails from growing too long and potentially causing discomfort.
7) She also trims the hair around the dog's face and body, which contributes to the dog having a neat and tidy appearance.
8) Finally, she poses with the dog for a photo, smiling and holding it close, which captures the moment of their bonding and the completion of the grooming session.
