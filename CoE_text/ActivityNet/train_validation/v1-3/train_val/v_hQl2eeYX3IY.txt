1) The man, wearing a red shirt, blue jeans, baseball cap, and sneakers, starts using a leaf blower to clear leaves from the driveway, which is surrounded by trees and has two cars parked nearby.
2) He begins by blowing the leaves into a pile, causing the dry, brown leaves (indicating it is autumn) to gather together.
3) After creating the pile, he then moves on to blow the leaves away from the driveway, directing them towards the yard and the side of the house, as he appears focused on his task.
