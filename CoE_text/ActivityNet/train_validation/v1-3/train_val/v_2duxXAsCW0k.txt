1) A person is standing next to a white Volkswagen Beetle parked on the side of a wet street at night, which causes the environment to be urban with buildings in the background, illuminated by streetlights that cast a soft glow on the scene.
2) The individual, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, appears to be cleaning or polishing the car's rear with a cloth, which leads to the man holding an umbrella in his right hand and cleaning the car with his left hand.
3) It's raining lightly as evidenced by the wet ground and the person's use of an umbrella, which necessitates the need for the man to hold the umbrella while he cleans.
4) The car has stickers on its rear window, and there are reflections of lights on the wet pavement, which correlates with the car having stickers on its hood and the presence of buildings with lit windows in the background.
5) The person moves around the car, focusing on different areas while maintaining their task, which results in the man occasionally looking at the car and adjusting his position.
