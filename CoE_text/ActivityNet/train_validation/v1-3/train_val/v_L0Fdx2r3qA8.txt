1) The video starts with a man in a kitchen holding a potato and a drill, which causes him to then show various tools laid out on the counter, including a drill, fork, and pliers.
2) After preparing, the man proceeds to use the drill to peel the potato while holding it steady with his other hand, causing the potato peels to fall into the sink as he works.
3) Throughout the process, the necessity for an even peel causes the man to occasionally adjust the position of the potato and the drill bit.
4) In order to remove the skin, the man is seen carefully rotating the potato against the drill bit while holding the fork against the rotating potato, contributing to the detailed depiction of the peeling process.
5) The completion of the peeling process, caused by the effective use of the drill and fork, leads to the peeled potato being left in the sink, marking the end of the video.
