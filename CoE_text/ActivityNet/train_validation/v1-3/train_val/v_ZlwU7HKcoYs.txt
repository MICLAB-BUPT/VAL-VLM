1) The video shows a person engaging in water sports behind a boat on a lake, which is the setting and initial condition for both scenarios.
2) The boat moving at a high speed causes the creation of a large wake behind it, providing the necessary conditions for both water skiing and wakeboarding.
3) In the case of water skiing, the skier holds onto a rope attached to the boat, and this attachment, combined with the boat's movement, causes the skier to be pulled along the water while leaning back slightly.
4) For wakeboarding, the wakeboarder also uses the rope and the boat's pull to perform various tricks and maneuvers, including jumps and turns, indicating that the high speed of the boat and the resulting wake are conducive to these actions.
