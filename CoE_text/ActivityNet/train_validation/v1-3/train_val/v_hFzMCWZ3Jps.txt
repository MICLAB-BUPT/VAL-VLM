1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'The Infamous Dookie Braid' in white text on a black background.
2) It then transitions to a woman with long, straight black hair standing in a bathroom with pink tiles and a towel rack visible, and she is wearing a white t-shirt and hoop earrings.
3) The woman starts by brushing her hair, which causes her to gather it into a ponytail using both hands.
4) She twists the ponytail tightly, creating a braided look, which leads her to take a section of her hair and begin to braid it, adding more hair as she goes along.
5) The braid is tight and neat, and she continues braiding until the end of her hair, after which she holds up a container of 'Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Edge Control'.
6) She uses a small brush to apply the product to her hairline, which results in her securing the braid with a small elastic band.
7) Finally, she waves goodbye to the camera.
