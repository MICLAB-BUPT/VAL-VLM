1) The video begins with a young girl standing in a kitchen, wearing a blue floral dress, and holding a clear glass, preparing to make a drink.
2) She pours water into the glass, initially from a bottle as seen in Answer 1, but also directly from a tap as indicated in Answer 2, which causes the glass to be filled with water.
3) The girl then squeezes lemon juice into the water using a lemon squeezer, adding a citrus flavor to it.
4) This action of squeezing lemon juice into the water leads her to stir the mixture with a spoon, ensuring that the lemon is well mixed with the water.
5) After stirring, she adds a packet of powder, likely a flavoring or sweetener, to the mixture, enhancing the taste of the beverage.
6) Finally, she inserts a straw into the glass and takes a sip, enjoying her homemade, refreshing lemon-infused water.
