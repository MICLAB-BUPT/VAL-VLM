1) The video begins with a close-up of a carved pumpkin lantern, showcasing its intricate design and glowing light.
2) The scene transitions to a kitchen counter where various tools for carving are laid out, including a pumpkin, a carving tool, a large spoon, a pattern pencil, scissors, a nail, and a vegetable peeler.
3) A person's hands are seen using the carving tool to cut into the top of the pumpkin, which causes the removal of the top.
4) After removing the top, the person scoops out the seeds and pulp with a large spoon, which prepares the pumpkin for carving.
5) Next, a pattern is traced onto contact paper and cut out, which is then placed on the pumpkin. This step allows for an accurate transfer of the design.
6) The person outlines the pattern with a nail, causing the design to be marked on the pumpkin, which guides the carving process.
7) The contact paper is then removed, and the person carefully cuts along the outlined lines, creating the desired design.
8) The person cleans up the edges, which refines the appearance of the carved sections.
9) Finally, a votive candle is placed inside the lantern, which, when lit, causes the completed pumpkin lantern to glow warmly in the dimly lit room.
