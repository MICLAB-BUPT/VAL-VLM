1) In a dimly lit arena with blue and white lights, three wrestlers are engaged in a match.
2) The central wrestler, initially wearing a blue and silver costume with a cape, is being lifted by two others dressed in black, executing a coordinated move that lifts the central figure high above their heads, which causes an intense moment of action.
3) The lighting focuses on the wrestlers, highlighting their movements against the darker background, and the audience, though not visible, is presumed to be in front of the stage, reacting to the spectacle.
4) Suddenly, the central wrestler, now described as wearing a black vest and pants, is hoisted onto the shoulders of another wrestler dressed in black shorts and boots, who then lifts him over his head, preparing for a move.
5) A third wrestler, also in black attire, stands by observing, while the surrounding environment remains focused on the dramatic action.
6) The central wrestler is then dropped onto a table below, causing it to shatter upon impact, and this action causes the surrounding wrestlers to react to the fall, with the fallen wrestler lying on the broken table.
