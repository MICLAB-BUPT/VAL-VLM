1) The woman, wearing a gray long-sleeve top, begins by presenting a red velvet cake with white frosting, which causes her to transition into the process of making the cake.
2) She prepares for baking by placing parchment paper into the pans and greasing them with butter, which allows the cakes to be easily removed after baking.
3) The woman mixes dry ingredients like flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda in a bowl, which is then combined with wet ingredients such as butter, sugar, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract in a stand mixer. This mixing causes the creation of a smooth batter.
4) Adding red food coloring to the mixture results in the vibrant red velvet color, which is a defining characteristic of a red velvet cake.
5) Pouring the batter into the prepared pans and baking it leads to the formation of the cake layers, which are then cooled on a wire rack.
6) Once the cake layers are cooled, she assembles the cake by layering the red velvet cake slices with white frosting, which creates a visually appealing layered effect.
7) The final step of assembling and decorating the cake with white frosting between layers and on top results in a beautifully decorated red velvet cake, ready for serving.
