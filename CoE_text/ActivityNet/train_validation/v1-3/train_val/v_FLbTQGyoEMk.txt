1) The video shows a person attempting to remove contact lenses from their eyes, which causes the person's face, with close-up shots of their eyes and hands, to be visible as they use their fingers to carefully pull the contact lens out of one eye at a time.
2) After removing the contact lenses, the person then decides to insert new or the same contact lenses back into their eyes, causing them to first look at the camera, then use their fingers to pull down their lower eyelid and carefully place the contact lens on the eye, repeating this process with the other eye to ensure both lenses are properly inserted.
