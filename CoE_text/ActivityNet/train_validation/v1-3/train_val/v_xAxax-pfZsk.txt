1) The video shows a man with a prosthetic leg sitting on the ground, putting on his prosthetic leg and rollerblades.
2) He then stands up, initially with the help of a woman, to start rollerblading on a sidewalk in a residential area.
3) At first, the man appears to be struggling but gradually gains confidence and balance, which causes him to skate more smoothly along the sidewalk, making turns and adjusting his posture.
4) During the process, he falls at one point, but this incident causes him to quickly recover and continue skating, demonstrating his determination.
5) After skating for a while, the man stops, removes his rollerblades, and sits back down on the ground.
