1) The video begins with a title screen displaying the text 'Hanging your wallpaper' and the 'Solite' logo, which then transitions to a woman in a white t-shirt and blue jeans demonstrating how to hang wallpaper on a wall.
2) The woman starts by using a brush to apply adhesive to the wall, preparing it for the wallpaper application, which causes the wallpaper to adhere properly when applied.
3) She carefully aligns the wallpaper at the top corner, smoothing it down, which ensures that there are no air bubbles or wrinkles, leading to a seamless appearance.
4) Using a brush, she presses the wallpaper firmly against the wall, ensuring it adheres without any issues, which results in a smooth and even surface.
5) As she continues to apply wallpaper, she uses a tool to cut the wallpaper along the edge of the wall, making precise cuts to fit the pattern, which leads to a clean and professional finish.
6) Throughout the process, she meticulously works on different sections of the wall, adjusting and smoothing the wallpaper as needed, which contributes to the overall quality of the finished project.
7) Finally, she makes final adjustments to the wallpaper, ensuring it is perfectly aligned and smooth, which concludes the demonstration.
