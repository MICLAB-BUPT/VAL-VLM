1) The person is performing a series of acrobatic stunts in a backyard setting, which causes them to start by swinging on a swing set.
2) As they swing, they gain momentum, causing them to launch themselves into the air.
3) The launch from the swing set leads to the individual executing a backflip, captured mid-air with their body fully extended and legs tucked in.
4) The successful execution of the backflip results in the person landing smoothly on a BMX bike positioned on the grass.
5) Upon landing, the individual maintains balance and control, which allows them to ride away from the swing set.
