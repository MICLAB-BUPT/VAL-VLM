1) The scuba diver, equipped with a full gear set including a mask, snorkel, fins, and an oxygen tank, begins the demonstration underwater.
2) The need to showcase proper techniques for propulsion and maneuvering causes the diver to perform various swimming styles such as the frog kick, shuffle kick, modified flutter kick, and reversed frog kick.
3) To further illustrate their control and maneuverability, the diver executes a helicopter turn, which is caused by the intention to display advanced skills in the video.
4) The presence of a sandy bottom with some coral formations in the background, along with sunlight filtering through the water, suggests that the setting is during the daytime, causing the video to have good visibility and natural lighting.
5) The inclusion of text overlays providing instructions and tips on scuba diving techniques is caused by the desire to educate the viewers on how to properly perform the demonstrated actions.
