1) The video starts with a man changing a tire on a car, using tools like a jack and lug wrench. He first removes the lug nuts from the flat tire using a tire iron, which causes him to be able to remove the flat tire.
2) After removing the flat tire, he replaces it with a spare tire, and then uses a hydraulic jack to lift the car off the ground, allowing him to attach the spare tire to the hub.
3) Once the spare tire is attached, he tightens the lug nuts on the spare tire, securing it in place, which enables him to safely drive away in the car.
4) The video then transitions to a woman in a purple jacket preparing for a tire change by opening a tool kit from the trunk of her white SUV, indicating a new but similar scenario.
5) She puts on safety gloves and positions a red reflective triangle behind the vehicle, enhancing safety before she begins the tire change, which leads to her starting the process.
6) Following the preparation, she removes the flat tire and replaces it with a spare tire, mirroring the steps taken by the man earlier.
7) Using the tool kit, she tightens the lug nuts on the spare tire, ensuring it is securely fastened, which results in the completion of the tire change.
8) Finally, after securing the spare tire onto the car, she drives away, concluding the event similarly to the man's situation.
