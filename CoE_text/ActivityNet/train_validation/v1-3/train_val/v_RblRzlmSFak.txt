1) The arrival of autumn causes the leaves to fall from the trees, scattering them across the grass in a residential yard.
2) To manage the fallen leaves, a person decides to use a large cardboard box (or sheet) as a tool for gathering them, indicating resourcefulness and a practical approach to the task.
3) The person moves around the yard, either bending down with the box or dragging the cardboard sheet behind them, which effectively gathers the leaves into a more manageable form.
4) As the person continues their work, they periodically lift the cardboard box (or move the sheet) to empty the collected leaves into a designated pile, showing the progression of their cleaning effort.
5) The visible patches of green grass between the leaf piles, along with the brown and yellow colors of the leaves, further confirm that the setting is a typical autumn scene in a residential area.
