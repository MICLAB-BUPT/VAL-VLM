1) The video begins with a title screen that reads 'Putting on and Taking off Contact Lenses' against an underwater background, which sets the stage for the instructional content.
2) It then transitions to a close-up of a person's eye, where the individual holds a contact lens close to their eye and carefully places it on the eye's surface, causing the lens to adhere to the eye.
3) After placing the lens, they use their fingers to gently adjust the lens once it is in place, ensuring it is properly positioned and comfortable.
4) Next, the video shows the person removing the contact lens by pinching the upper lid of the eye and gently pulling the lower eyelid down, which causes the lens to be pushed out, demonstrating the safe and effective method for removal.
5) The actions are performed with precision and care throughout, ensuring the safety and comfort of the eyes during the process.
6) The video concludes with a thank you message displayed over the underwater background, encouraging viewers to keep practicing, which reinforces the educational goal of the demonstration.
