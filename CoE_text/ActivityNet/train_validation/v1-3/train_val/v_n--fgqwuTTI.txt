1) The video begins with a white screen that transitions to a black screen, followed by a close-up of a bicycle's rear wheel and chain.
2) A hand holding a tool labeled 'Park Tool' appears, measuring the chain length, which causes the person to determine if the chain needs to be cut or adjusted.
3) The person then uses a blue-handled tool to cut the chain at the correct length, ensuring it is properly aligned and secured.
4) After cutting, the person connects the two ends of the chain and tightens it, which involves manipulating the chain links and using the tool to make precise adjustments.
5) Finally, the person checks the tension of the chain and makes any necessary adjustments, ensuring everything is in place.
