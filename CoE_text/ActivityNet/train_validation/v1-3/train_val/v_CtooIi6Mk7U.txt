1) The video shows two men on a rooftop, one wearing a blue and white striped shirt and the other in a green shirt, flying kites together. This causes them to be engaged in an activity that involves looking up at the sky and handling kite strings and spools.
2) The scene then shifts, causing the viewer to see a woman in a sari standing on the same rooftop, holding a spool of string and looking up at the sky, which indicates she is also participating in the kite flying activity.
3) As the video continues, it captures a man and the woman on the rooftop, with the man actively flying a kite by holding and maneuvering the kite string. This causes the woman to stand nearby, observing the kite and the man's actions, thereby engaging both of them in the shared experience of kite flying.
