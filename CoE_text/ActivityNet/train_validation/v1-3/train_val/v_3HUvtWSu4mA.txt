1) The video begins with a title screen in Italian, 'Come tagliare le unghie al gatto' (How to cut a cat's nails), followed by another screen indicating the clip is from 2010.
2) The scene transitions to a person sitting on a couch with a tabby cat, demonstrating how to trim the cat's nails using a pair of nail clippers. The cat appears calm and cooperative during the process, allowing the person to gently hold it on their lap while trimming its claws, which causes the first demonstration to be successful.
3) Another title screen appears, 'Caso Difficile' (Difficult Case), showing the person attempting to trim the nails of a more agitated tabby cat. The increased agitation of the cat leads to the person struggling to keep the cat still, but eventually, they manage to trim the nails, making this case more challenging.
4) A third title screen reads 'Caso impossibile' (Impossible Case), depicting the person trying to trim the nails of an extremely agitated tabby cat that resists and moves around vigorously. The high level of resistance and movement from the cat causes the person to be unable to successfully trim the cat's nails.
5) The video ends with a final title screen, 'MORALE: Da ora in poi, tagliamo le unghie solo alla gatta tonta...' (Moral: From now on, we will only trim the nails of the stupid cat...). This conclusion is drawn because of the varying levels of difficulty and success encountered when trimming the nails of different cats, with the easiest being the calm and cooperative one.
