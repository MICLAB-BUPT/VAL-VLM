1) The video starts with a man standing next to a bicycle mounted on a yellow stand in an indoor setting, causing him to begin explaining something about the bicycle while gesturing towards it.
2) This explanation leads to the man kneeling beside two bicycle wheels placed on a white foam board, which causes him to remove the wheels and reveal a cardboard box containing parts of a disassembled bicycle.
3) The revelation of the disassembled bicycle parts then causes the man to proceed with assembling the bicycle, attaching the wheels to the frame and adjusting various components like the handlebars and gears.
