1) The video starts with a title screen that reads 'How to correctly Apply Sunscreen' on a blue background, which then transitions to a woman standing in front of a mirror, holding a bottle of sunscreen and speaking to the camera.
2) The woman holding the sunscreen causes her to start the demonstration by explaining its use, which leads to her using a spatula to scoop out the sunscreen from the bottle.
3) Scooping out the sunscreen with a spatula causes her to apply it to her hand, and then warming up the sunscreen in her hands is done before she applies it to her face, ensuring that the sunscreen is at an optimal temperature for application.
4) Warming up the sunscreen in her hands causes her to demonstrate the application process by rubbing the sunscreen onto her face and neck, ensuring even coverage, which is crucial for effective sun protection.
5) After demonstrating the application, the woman advises viewers to apply sunscreen before makeup, reinforcing the importance of proper timing in a skincare routine.
