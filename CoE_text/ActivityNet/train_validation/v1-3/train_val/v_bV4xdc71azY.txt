1) The video begins with a person standing in a kitchen, holding a blue frying pan over a stove.
2) They pour beaten eggs into the pan, which causes the cooking process to start.
3) The person uses a spatula to stir and fold the mixture, ensuring that the eggs cook evenly.
4) Throughout the process, they occasionally shake the pan, which also helps in achieving even cooking.
5) After the eggs are cooked, the person adds shredded cheese to the eggs, leading to the cheese starting to melt and blend with the eggs.
6) Once the cheese is incorporated, the person continues to fold the omelet, resulting in a well-combined and cheesy omelet.
7) The person then uses a knife to cut the omelet into pieces, preparing it for serving.
