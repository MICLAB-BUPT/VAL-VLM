1) The man in a red shirt and black pants starts by picking up a curling stone from the floor, which is the initial action that sets the game in motion.
2) He then slides the curling stone across the ice while holding a broom in his other hand, causing the stone to move towards the target area.
3) As he releases the stone, he uses the broom to sweep the ice in front of it, which guides and influences the path of the stone.
4) After releasing the stone, he stands up and continues to sweep the ice with the broom as it moves towards the target area, further affecting its trajectory and speed.
5) Finally, he walks back towards the starting point, marking the end of this particular delivery process.
