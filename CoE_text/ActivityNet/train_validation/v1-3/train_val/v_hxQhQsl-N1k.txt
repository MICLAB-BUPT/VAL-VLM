1) The man is in a gym setting, dressed in athletic attire including a black long-sleeve shirt and dark shorts, which prepares him for the workout.
2) He positions himself on one knee with the other leg bent at a 90-degree angle to support his body, causing a stable base for performing the exercise.
3) Holding a dumbbell in his right hand, he begins the half-kneeling dumbbell shoulder press by extending his arm straight out in front of him, then pressing the dumbbell upwards until it reaches shoulder height, keeping his elbow slightly bent, which targets and strengthens his shoulder muscles.
4) After reaching the top position, he slowly lowers the dumbbell back to the starting position, which completes one repetition and ensures controlled muscle engagement.
5) This movement is repeated multiple times throughout the video, causing an effective workout session for the targeted muscle groups.
