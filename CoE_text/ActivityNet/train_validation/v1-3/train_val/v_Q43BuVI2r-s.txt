1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the topic of installing underlayment for flooring, which causes the viewers to understand the context and purpose of the demonstration.
2) Following the introduction, scenes of people unrolling and applying various types of underlayments on different floor surfaces are shown, leading to a detailed process being demonstrated.
3) In one specific scene, a man in a yellow shirt and blue jeans unrolls a large green sheet on the floor, causing the underlayment material to be laid out across the surface.
4) As he unrolls the sheet, another person in a black shirt and blue jeans assists by holding the other end, ensuring that the underlayment is evenly distributed and positioned correctly.
5) The man then uses a tool to smooth out the sheet, making sure it is flat and even, which leads to the creation of a smooth and even surface necessary for proper adhesion and fit.
6) After smoothing, the process involves measuring, cutting, and further smoothing the underlayments, resulting in the underlayment being properly fitted and secured with tape.
7) The completion of these steps causes the installation to reach its final stage, where the video concludes with a shot of the completed installation, highlighting the smooth and even surface of the underlayment.
