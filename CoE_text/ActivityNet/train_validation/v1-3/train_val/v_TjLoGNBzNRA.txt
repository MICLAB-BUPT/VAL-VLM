1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'STARS ON WALLS' and the website address, which causes the viewer to understand the context of the content.
2) It transitions to a woman in a grey t-shirt and jeans preparing a wall for wallpaper application, ensuring it's clean and smooth, which is a necessary step to create a suitable surface for the wallpaper.
3) She then kneels on the floor, unrolls a large sheet of white wallpaper, and carefully aligns it against the wall, causing the wallpaper to be correctly positioned before application.
4) The woman proceeds to hang the wallpaper, starting from the top and smoothing it down as she goes, which ensures that the wallpaper is applied without wrinkles or air bubbles.
5) She uses a paint roller to press the wallpaper firmly against the wall, removing any air bubbles, which results in a smooth and well-adhered finish.
6) After hanging the wallpaper, she trims off any excess at the floor and ceiling using a metal tool, which leads to a neat and professional appearance.
7) Finally, she stands back to admire her work, showcasing the completed wallpaper with the Arsenal logo prominently displayed, which allows the viewer to see the final result of her efforts.
