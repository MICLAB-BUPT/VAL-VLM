1) The woman starts by brushing her wet hair, which is a preparatory step to remove tangles and make the hair easier to manage, causing a smoother blow-drying process.
2) She then applies a product from a small bottle, either 'Moroccanoil Treatment Light' or 'macadamia', to her hair, which serves to protect her hair from heat damage and add moisture, leading to healthier and more manageable hair during and after the blow-drying.
3) Next, she uses a round brush and a hairdryer to style her hair, sectioning it off with a yellow clip for better control and even drying, resulting in a more polished and styled look.
4) In one scenario, she gathers her hair into a ponytail and secures it with a yellow clip before blow-drying, which helps in managing the hair and achieving a specific styling outcome, such as added volume or smoothness.
5) She continues to dry and style her hair, using the brush and hairdryer in tandem, ensuring that each section of hair is dried and styled evenly, contributing to a uniform and well-groomed final appearance.
6) After styling, she runs her fingers through her hair to loosen any tightness, which prevents the hair from looking too stiff or over-styled, leading to a more natural and relaxed finish.
7) In one of the scenarios, she applies a product from a tube labeled 'SheaMoisture' to her hair, massaging it into her scalp for even distribution, which provides additional nourishment and care to the scalp and hair, enhancing the overall health and appearance of her hair.
