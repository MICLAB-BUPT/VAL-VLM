1) The video begins with a black screen displaying white text in Portuguese, which causes the introduction of a news anchor in a studio setting.
2) The news anchor, wearing a black top and a turquoise necklace, is seen with the 'FOX 13' logo visible on the screen, leading to the scene transitioning to historical images of people playing shuffleboard, including a man in a suit and hat, and a group of people gathered around a shuffleboard table.
3) These historical images then cause the transition to modern-day shuffleboard court scenes, where people are shown playing, including an elderly woman in a white shirt and cap.
4) The inclusion of close-up shots of shuffleboard discs on the court, as well as wide shots of the courts and surrounding areas, results in the conclusion of the video with a black screen displaying the 'FOX 13 Tampa Bay' logo.
