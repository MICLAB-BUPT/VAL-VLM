1) A woman in a green top and beige pants is playing shuffleboard on a cruise ship deck.
2) She's using a cue to push a puck along the court marked with numbers, which causes her to take a shot.
3) After taking the shot, she walks back to her starting position.
4) The presence of another person (a woman in black) standing nearby watching her play, and a man in a blue shirt and dark pants standing further back, also observing the game, indicates that they are interested in or engaged by the shuffleboard game.
5) The deck has a wooden floor and shuffleboard markings, with pucks scattered around, providing the necessary setup for the game.
6) The visibility of railings and the ocean in the background establishes that the game is being played on an open deck of a cruise ship.
