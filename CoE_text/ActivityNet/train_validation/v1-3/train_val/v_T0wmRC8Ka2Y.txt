1) The sky is cloudy and the weather appears to be overcast, which causes the players to wear casual beachwear, including shorts and tank tops, suitable for the mild temperature.
2) The volleyball net set up in the middle of the court divides it into two equal halves, enabling the players to spread out across the court and engage in the game by jumping, diving, and hitting the ball back and forth over the net.
3) The light-colored, well-maintained sand and the visible trees and buildings in the background, indicating a larger resort or community area, contribute to creating a casual and relaxed atmosphere where the players can actively participate in the dynamic movements and coordination required for the sport.
