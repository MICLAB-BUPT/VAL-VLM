1) The woman starts by brushing and spraying her hair, which prepares the hair for styling.
2) She then braids it into a French braid using a comb to separate the strands of hair, causing the hair to be neatly arranged in a braid.
3) After completing the braid, she secures the end of the braid with a small gold hairpin or a hair tie, ensuring that the braid stays in place.
4) Next, she gathers the remaining hair into a ponytail and secures it with a hair tie, leading to all the loose hair being pulled back.
5) Finally, she sprays her hair with hairspray to set the style, resulting in the hairstyle staying in place with added volume and shine.
