1) The person, dressed in dark clothing and jeans, begins by engaging the parking brake on the green and black child seat attached to the white bicycle, which causes the bicycle to remain stationary during the process.
2) They then lower the caster wheels by pressing a button, which allows for easier maneuvering of the child seat when it is detached from the bicycle.
3) The individual releases the leader link, breaking the connection between the bicycle and the child seat, and lifts the cycle pod off the child seat, thus uncoupling the two components.
4) The person repositions the pushbar backwards, setting the parking brake again, and lowers both caster wheels, preparing the child seat for re-coupling or independent use.
5) They release the leader link once more and secure the pod clamp, ensuring that the child seat is stable and ready for the bicycle to be re-attached.
6) Finally, they lift the bicycle back onto the child seat, making sure it is securely attached, and reposition the pushbar backwards again, engaging the steering lock, which concludes the coupling process and ensures the Zigo Leader bicycle with the child seat is safe and ready for use.
