1) The video clip shows a person demonstrating the use of a croquet mallet, which causes the viewer to understand the proper handling and technique.
2) Initially, the mallet is held vertically with the head resting on the ground, causing the person to have a stable starting position before making any movements.
3) The person then adjusts their grip and positions the mallet horizontally to hit a croquet ball, causing the transition from a preparatory stance to an active play stance.
4) Holding the mallet with both hands and striking the croquet ball on a grassy field, causes the ball to roll across the grass towards a croquet hoop, illustrating the objective of the game.
5) The person's movements are smooth and controlled as they swing the mallet to hit the ball, causing the ball to move in the intended direction and speed.
6) After striking the ball, they return the mallet to its original vertical position, causing the completion of one cycle of action and preparing for the next move or turn.
