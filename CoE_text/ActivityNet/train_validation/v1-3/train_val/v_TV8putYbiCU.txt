1) The woman in an orange shirt and blue jeans is standing in a bathroom, talking to the camera, which causes her to start demonstrating how to clean a bathroom sink.
2) She begins by turning on the faucet and letting the water run, which then leads to her picking up a bottle of Soft Scrub cleaner.
3) Spraying the sink with the Soft Scrub cleaner causes her to use a paper towel to wipe down the sink and the surrounding area, emphasizing the effectiveness and ease of use of the cleaning products.
4) After wiping down the sink, she rinses her hands under running water from the faucet, which results in her turning off the faucet.
5) Finally, having completed the demonstration, she smiles at the camera.
