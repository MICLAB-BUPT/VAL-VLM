1) The wall is in a state of disrepair, with patches of old paint and plaster visible, which causes the need for renovation.
2) A person, dressed in work attire (a dark-colored shirt in one observation and a black jacket with white stripes on the sleeves in another), decides to apply plaster to the wall, indicating they are engaged in manual labor or renovation work.
3) To address the wall's condition, the person uses a trowel, a tool suitable for spreading plaster, to methodically and carefully spread the thick, smooth, white plaster over the wall, ensuring an even and smooth application.
