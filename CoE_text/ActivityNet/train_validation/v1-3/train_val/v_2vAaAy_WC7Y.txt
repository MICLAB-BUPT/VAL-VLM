1) The woman, wearing a striped shirt and a pink apron with white polka dots, is in a kitchen setting, which causes her to be prepared for baking.
2) She begins by pouring ingredients into a measuring jug, which leads to the accurate measurement of the necessary components for the cake.
3) After measuring, she mixes the ingredients, which results in a well-blended batter suitable for baking.
4) The mixture is then poured into a black bowl, which facilitates the transfer of the batter to a baking pan lined with parchment paper.
5) The batter is placed in the oven, causing the cake to bake until it is ready.
6) Upon removing the cake from the oven, she places it on a wooden cutting board, allowing it to cool and making it easier to cut.
7) She cuts the cake into slices, which enables her to apply a dark-colored icing on top, giving the cake its glossy black topping.
8) To complete the decoration, she adds red licorice strips to resemble eyes, enhancing the 'baked goods' look.
9) Additionally, she uses a white icing bag to add details to the cake's decoration, further improving the visual appeal of the cake.
