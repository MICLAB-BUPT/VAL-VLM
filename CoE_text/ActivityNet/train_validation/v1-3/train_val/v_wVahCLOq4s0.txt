1) The video begins with a woman in a kitchen setting, holding a pumpkin and smiling at the camera.
2) She then proceeds to carve the pumpkin using various tools such as a knife, spoon, and scooping tool, which causes the initial shape of the design to form.
3) The woman carefully cuts out the eyes, nose, and mouth of the pumpkin, ensuring precision in her work, which results in a well-defined face on the pumpkin.
4) She also removes the seeds and pulp from inside the pumpkin, causing the interior to be clean and ready for further decoration.
5) After carving, she uses a permanent marker to draw on the pumpkin, adding details to the design, which enhances the overall appearance of the carved face.
6) Finally, she cleans up any remaining debris, which leads to a neat and presentable finished product, and proudly displays the finished pumpkin, which now features a spooky face.
