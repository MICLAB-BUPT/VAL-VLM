1) The process of making a giant cookie cake begins with the mixing of ingredients such as eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a glass bowl using a yellow spatula, which causes the formation of the wet mixture.
2) Flour is then added to another bowl and mixed, creating the dry mixture. The combination of the wet and dry mixtures leads to the creation of the cookie dough.
3) Chocolate chips are incorporated into the dough, enhancing its flavor and texture, and the dough is transferred onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, where it is spread out evenly, causing a uniform thickness for even baking.
4) More chocolate chips are sprinkled on top, adding extra flavor, and the cookie cake is baked for 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, resulting in a fully cooked, golden-brown cookie cake.
5) After baking, the cookie cake is decorated with colorful candies arranged in a pattern around the edge and a heart shape in the center, and drizzled with chocolate, leading to an aesthetically pleasing and appetizing appearance.
6) A child's involvement in arranging candies on a wooden board adds a personal touch to the decoration, contributing to the overall presentation.
7) Finally, the video concludes with a slice of the cookie cake being cut and served on a white plate, showcasing its texture and layers, which demonstrates the successful completion of the cooking and decorating process.
