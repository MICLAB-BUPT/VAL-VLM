1) The video showcases two women playing shuffleboard on a wooden deck of a cruise ship, which causes the scene to be set against a backdrop of the ocean and the ship's railing.
2) The deck is marked with white lines and numbers, indicating the scoring zones for the game, which enables the players to aim for the highest scoring areas.
3) The women are using long cues (sticks) to push black and red discs (pucks) across the court, causing the camera to capture their actions and the movement of the pucks from various angles, including close-ups.
4) The natural lighting and sunny weather cause the scene to appear bright and inviting, leading to other passengers walking around the deck and enjoying the day.
