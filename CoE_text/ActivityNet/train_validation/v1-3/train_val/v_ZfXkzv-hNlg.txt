1) The group of people are on an inflatable raft navigating through a river with strong currents and rapids, which causes them to wear safety gear including helmets and life jackets in various colors.
2) The challenging conditions of the river cause the participants to actively paddle using their paddles, coordinating their efforts to steer and propel the raft.
3) The natural setting with lush greenery on the banks of the river under a clear sky, along with the vibrant turquoise color of the water, indicates that the river is clean and possibly glacial-fed, which attracts the group to engage in this adventurous activity.
