1) In an outdoor setting with a blue tarp on the ground, two individuals are engaged in what appears to be a playful wrestling match. The environment includes a residential building with visible windows and a red brick exterior, a ladder leaning against the wall, and traffic cones placed around the area.
2) One person is wearing a black hoodie and grey pants, while the other is dressed in all black attire (specifically, a black sleeveless top and black pants).
3) They start by grappling with each other, which leads to the individual in the black hoodie grabbing the other's hair.
4) This action causes the person in the hoodie to lift the other off the ground.
5) The lifting then results in the execution of a flip.
6) The flip ends with both falling onto their backs on the tarp.
7) The lighting suggests it's daytime with overcast skies, providing soft natural light without harsh shadows, which enhances the visibility of the actions.
