1) The video features a person playing conga drums in an indoor setting, which causes the individual to be dressed in a dark-colored long-sleeve shirt and positioned in front of three congas arranged in a semicircle.
2) The arrangement of the congas on stands with natural wood finishes and black bases, and the placement of a smartphone on top of the middle drum, enables the person to use both hands to rhythmically strike the drumheads, creating a variety of sounds.
3) The fluid and coordinated movements of the person, striking the drumheads with their palms and fingers, demonstrate skill and familiarity with the instrument, which is evidenced by the rhythmic beats produced.
