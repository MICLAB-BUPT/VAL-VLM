1) The man, dressed in a red t-shirt and black shorts, enters the gym setting, which causes him to be in an environment equipped with various gym equipment like treadmills and weights.
2) In order to demonstrate the use of a rowing machine, he first adjusts the machine, securing his feet into the footrests, which prepares him for the exercise.
3) With his feet secured, he begins performing the rowing exercise, pulling the handle towards his chest with his arms extended and then pushing it away, while also pushing off the footrests with his legs, causing a full-body workout.
4) The deliberate and focused movements on demonstrating proper form, combined with the bright lighting, highlight the man's actions and the gym environment, including the motivational poster and red walls, making the demonstration clear and instructional.
