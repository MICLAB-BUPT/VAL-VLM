1) The video starts with a close-up shot of a plate filled with freshly baked cookies, followed by a list of ingredients and their measurements, which causes the viewer to understand what will be needed for the recipe.
2) The ingredients, including butter, sugar, flour, and raw sugar for coating, are laid out on a wooden surface, causing the preparation stage to begin.
3) A person uses an electric mixer to beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, which is done to incorporate air into the mixture, leading to a lighter texture in the final product.
4) Flour is added to the mixture to form a dough, causing the transformation from wet ingredients to a solid, workable dough.
5) The dough is kneaded by hand until smooth, then rolled into a log or long rectangular shape, which prepares it for slicing and ensures even baking.
6) Sprinkling or coating the dough with raw sugar before wrapping it in plastic wrap adds a crunchy texture to the exterior of the cookies once they are baked.
7) Chilling the dough in the freezer or refrigerator for about 30 minutes causes the fats in the dough to solidify, making it easier to slice and helping the cookies maintain their shape during baking.
8) After chilling, the dough is sliced into even pieces and placed on a baking sheet, setting up for an evenly baked batch of cookies.
9) Baking the cookies until lightly golden causes them to cook through and develop a slightly crisp outer layer, while remaining soft inside.
10) Transferring the baked cookies to a cooling rack allows them to cool down, which prevents overcooking and ensures that they set properly.
11) Finally, stacking the cooled cookies neatly in a clear container presents the end result of the process, ready for consumption or storage.
