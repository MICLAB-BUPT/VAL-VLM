1) The video takes place outdoors, likely in a backyard with green grass and trees, setting the scene for a casual outdoor party during daylight.
2) A piñata shaped like a character from 'Inside Out' is hanging from a tree branch, serving as the target for the children's game.
3) A child in a blue dress is holding a red stick, attempting to hit the piñata, which causes the focus of the video to shift between her and the surrounding party attendees.
4) She swings the stick at the piñata but misses, leading to another girl coming up to her and taking the stick from her.
5) The second girl then swings the stick at the piñata and successfully hits it, causing a shift in the action and possibly excitement among the party attendees.
