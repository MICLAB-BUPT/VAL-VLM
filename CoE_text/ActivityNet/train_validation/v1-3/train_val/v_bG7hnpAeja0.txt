1) The video begins with a group of sumo wrestlers walking down a street, which causes them to be seen running in the next scene.
2) The scene of the sumo wrestlers running then transitions to a group of people in white clothing (likely the sumo wrestlers themselves) standing together, causing the depiction of various activities such as people (the sumo wrestlers) running and a man in a suit (possibly one of the sumo wrestlers or an onlooker) walking on the street.
3) These activities lead to a group of people (sumo wrestlers) sitting at a table, which is followed by the sumo wrestlers engaging in other activities like playing basketball and eating at a gas station, as shown in the video.
4) The sumo wrestlers' run through different locations, including the beach, is caused by their initial running activity, and this leads to them being shown running up a hill and through other locations such as a park, thus completing the sequence of their urban adventure.
