1) The video begins with a title screen for 'Skin Elements USA LLC' and transitions to a woman standing in front of a surfboard, wearing a black t-shirt with green leaf designs.
2) She holds a tube of Skin Elements sunscreen, which causes her to apply it to her arm by squeezing the sunscreen from the tube onto her hand.
3) Rubbing the sunscreen into her skin ensures even coverage, causing the scene to shift to a close-up of the product packaging, showing three tubes of sunscreen.
4) Text overlays provide instructions on how to use the product, including removing the tube from the box, checking the expiration date, and applying the sunscreen properly, which leads to the inclusion of tips for using the product effectively, such as applying it after showering and reapplying every two hours during sun exposure.
5) The final frame displays contact information for Skin Elements USA, concluding the demonstration.
