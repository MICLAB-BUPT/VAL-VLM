1) A man in a white shirt and black pants is standing in front of three posters on the wall, one of which says 'Sub-Mariner'.
2) The man is holding a microphone in his right hand, indicating he is likely speaking or about to speak.
3) He is gesturing with his left hand as he speaks, suggesting that he is emphasizing or pointing out aspects of the posters.
4) The action of holding a microphone and gesturing causes the inference that the man is explaining something about the posters.
