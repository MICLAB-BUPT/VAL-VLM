1) The video begins with a man in white clothing and a cap working on a construction site, which causes him to be seen mixing materials (cement) in a machine.
2) After the cement is mixed, it is used to apply onto a brick wall, leading to the man using a long tool to spread the cement evenly across the wall.
3) The application of cement onto the wall causes the man to then smooth out the surface, likely using a trowel, to ensure an even finish.
4) Following the application and smoothing of the cement, the man places a wooden frame against the wall, securing it in place, indicating the completion of this stage of work.
5) The video ends with a view of the room, showing the progress made on the wall, as a result of the man's focused and methodical actions.
