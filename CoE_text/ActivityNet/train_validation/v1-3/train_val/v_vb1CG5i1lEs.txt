1) The video shows a person in a white protective suit and mask using a pressure washer to clean a wooden fence, which is initially dirty with visible dirt and grime on its surface.
2) As the person sprays water onto the fence, the dirt begins to wash away, revealing the natural wood color underneath, and they methodically move along the fence ensuring all areas are thoroughly cleaned, causing the ground around the fence to appear wet from the water spray.
3) After cleaning, the person, still in a white protective suit and mask, starts spraying the wooden fence with a spray gun, indicating that they have moved on to treating the fence.
4) The fence now has a mix of light and dark brown colors, showing that some areas have been treated while others remain untreated, and the person methodically moves the spray gun back and forth, starting from one end and working their way down, to ensure even coverage on the fence.
