1) A young boy in a red shirt and black shorts is attempting to mow the lawn with a green push mower.
2) The boy struggles to push the heavy mower across the grass, which appears to be uneven or has some obstacles, causing him to lean forward and use both hands to push it.
3) The environment is a residential backyard, with a white house, a parked car, and a fence visible in the background, setting the scene for this activity.
4) It's daytime with natural light casting shadows on the ground, providing good visibility for the task.
5) The grass is green but not uniformly cut, indicating it might need more attention, which is the reason the boy is mowing the lawn.
6) The lawn mower, with its black handle and wheels, moves slowly across the grass due to the weight and the condition of the lawn, making the task more challenging for the boy.
