1) The video begins with a title screen, which causes the viewer to understand the content of the tutorial.
2) The transition to a woman in a red top demonstrating the hairstyle causes the viewer to see the process in action.
3) The woman starts by grabbing a strand of hair from the top of her head and dividing it into three sections, which allows her to begin the braiding process.
4) Crossing the strands over each other and adding more hair to each section as she moves down the length of her hair causes the creation of a twisted braid.
5) Reaching the end of her hair and securing the remaining hair at the back of her head with a hair elastic causes the formation of a ponytail.
6) Using a bobby pin to secure the twisted braid to the ponytail completes the hairstyle, ensuring that the braid stays in place.
