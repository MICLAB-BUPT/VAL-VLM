1) The video begins with a person's hands holding a bicycle wheel, which is detached from the bike.
2) The person then proceeds to remove the hub from the wheel using a tool, causing the hub to be separated from the rim.
3) They take out the spokes and lay them on the table, leading to the wheel being without any spokes.
4) The person applies glue to the hub and starts attaching the spokes one by one, ensuring they are evenly spaced, which results in the gradual reassembly of the wheel.
5) Once all the spokes are attached, the person checks the alignment of the wheel and makes any necessary adjustments, causing the wheel to become properly aligned.
6) Finally, the person reattaches the wheel to the bike, completing the process of repairing or assembling the wheel.
