1) In the video, a man and a woman are seen using a rowing machine in a gym setting, which causes them to be positioned on opposite sides of the machine - the man on the left and the woman on the right.
2) They both appear to be engaged in a synchronized rowing exercise, moving their bodies back and forth in a rhythmic motion, which leads to their legs being extended forward as they lean back slightly, mimicking the natural rowing movement.
3) The rowing machine has a large fan at the front, which is likely used for resistance during the workout, thus enhancing the effectiveness of their exercise.
4) The background features various gym equipment and a wall with the text 'EZ2 HUMAN PERFORMANCE' prominently displayed, indicating that this fitness activity is taking place at the 'EZ2 HUMAN PERFORMANCE CENTER'.
