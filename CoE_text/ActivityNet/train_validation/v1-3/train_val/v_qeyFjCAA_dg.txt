1) The video starts with a black screen that transitions to a title card reading 'BURN EM OUT FITNESS' in bold red letters against a smoky background, which causes the scene to shift to a man lying on his back on a bed, wearing a sleeveless dark blue shirt and dark pants with a red logo.
2) The man begins by stretching his arms above his head, which leads to him proceeding to do sit-ups, lifting his upper body towards his knees while keeping his hands behind his head.
3) He continues this exercise routine for several repetitions, maintaining a steady pace, which results in showcasing his abdominal muscles.
4) After completing the sit-ups, he lies back down on the bed, resting his hands on his stomach, which causes the video to conclude with another title card displaying 'BURN EM OUT FITNESS' in bold red letters against a smoky background, similar to the opening.
