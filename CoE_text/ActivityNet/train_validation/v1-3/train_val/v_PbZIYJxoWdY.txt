3) The man jumping off the cliff and the subsequent wakeboarding activities cause the introduction of a group of people on a boat, engaging in various water sports.

5) A man holding a selfie stick while wakeboarding, and a woman wakeboarding with another person in the background, cause the continuation of the wakeboarding scenes.
6) The wakeboarding and preparation activities on the boat cause the scene to return to the man and the woman, who after climbing the cliff, jump off it into the water.
