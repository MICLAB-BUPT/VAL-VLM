1) The video depicts a man in a maroon jacket and dark pants using a rake and a shovel to gather fallen leaves on a sidewalk, which causes the leaves to be collected into a manageable pile.
2) After gathering the leaves, the man lifts them with the rake, causing the leaves to be elevated off the ground.
3) The elevation of the leaves then allows him to dump them into a nearby trash can, resulting in the sidewalk being cleared of the fallen leaves.
4) This process is repeated several times, leading to the systematic cleaning of the sidewalk.
