1) The woman in a kitchen setting, wearing a pink cardigan over a graphic t-shirt, begins by explaining the process of peeling potatoes using a bottle of essential oil and a green scrubber.
2) She then demonstrates how to use the scrubber on the potatoes while they are still hot from boiling, which causes the peels to come off more easily.
3) The peeled potatoes are directly placed over a large metal bowl to catch any debris, ensuring the kitchen remains clean.
4) After the initial peeling, she places the peeled potatoes into a pot of boiling water, causing them to cook.
5) Once the potatoes are boiled, she drains them and places them into a bowl, preparing for the next step.
6) Finally, she peels the boiled potatoes again, this time without any tools, and shows the peeled potatoes to the camera, completing the demonstration.
