1) The video shows a young man practicing hurling in a grassy backyard, which is the setting for the event.
2) The man, dressed in a grey t-shirt, dark pants with a stripe, and a cap, uses a hurley stick to hit a sliotar (ball), indicating his engagement in the sport of hurling, a traditional Irish game.
3) He demonstrates various hurling techniques, including striking the ball with the hurley, catching it, and running while carrying the stick, which showcases his skill and the different aspects of the sport.
4) Another person sitting on a bench in the background observes the practice, suggesting they are there to watch or support the man's training session.
5) The presence of a wooden fence, trees, and a small goalpost, along with an overcast sky, sets the scene, possibly implying that the practice takes place in early evening or during cloudy weather, which could be a preferred time to avoid the heat or sun.
