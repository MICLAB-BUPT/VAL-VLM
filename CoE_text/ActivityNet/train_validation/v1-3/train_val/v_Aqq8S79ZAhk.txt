1) The video begins with two women discussing a project, which is the creation of a mosaic tile shower floor, in a room with unfinished walls and a staircase in the background.
2) This discussion causes them to start selecting and arranging various colored stones (or pebbles) from a box, preparing them for the mosaic design.
3) After preparation, they apply adhesive to the floor, which allows them to carefully place the stones (pebbles) onto it, ensuring they are evenly spaced and aligned.
4) Their careful placement and attention to detail cause the transformation of the shower area, with the stone mosaic becoming fully installed and looking polished.
5) The completion of the mosaic installation leads to the final frames of the video, which reveal the completed shower, featuring an elegant and modern appearance with a combination of stone tiles and smooth surfaces.
