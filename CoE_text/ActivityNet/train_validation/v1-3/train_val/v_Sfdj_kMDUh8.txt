1) The video begins with an empty room featuring a plain grey carpet and a white wall with the 'ege' logo, setting the stage for the installation process.
2) Various tools and materials, including a roll of beige underlay, a black tool, a blue tool, metal clips, and a red-handled tool, are laid out on the floor, preparing the necessary items for the task.
3) A person wearing a black shirt and pants enters the frame, unrolling the beige underlay over the grey carpet, initiating the first step in the installation.
4) The person uses a blue tool to cut the underlay along a marked line, ensuring precision, which is crucial for a proper fit.
5) Adhesive is then applied to the underlay using a brush, spreading it evenly across the surface, which causes the underlay to adhere properly to the existing grey carpet.
6) After applying the adhesive, the person aligns and places the beige underlay over the grey carpet, smoothing it out with their hands, which ensures there are no wrinkles or air bubbles.
7) Metal clips are placed at intervals along the edge of the underlay, and a heavy roller is used to press down the underlay, causing it to adhere more securely and providing a smooth, even surface.
8) Finally, the person uses a vacuum cleaner to remove any loose particles from the carpet, leaving the room clean and ready for the next stage of installation, which concludes the preparation for further work.
