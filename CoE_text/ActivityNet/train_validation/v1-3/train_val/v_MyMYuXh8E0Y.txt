1) In a kitchen, two men are present. One man is wearing a black hoodie and the other is in a blue jacket.
2) The man in the black hoodie holds a bottle of mouthwash, which causes him to pour it into a glass.
3) They both drink from the glass, causing them to engage in an activity together.
4) After drinking, the man in the blue jacket takes out a piece of paper with 'A' written on it and shows it to the camera, which leads to him putting the paper back into a drawer.
5) This action by the man in the blue jacket prompts the man in the black hoodie to retrieve another piece of paper with 'TRUE' written on it and show it to the camera, then he puts the paper back into the drawer.
6) Subsequently, the man in the blue jacket retrieves a third piece of paper with 'LOL' written on it, shows it to the camera, and then puts the paper back into the drawer.
7) This sequence continues with the man in the black hoodie retrieving a fourth piece of paper with 'You Fanny' written on it, showing it to the camera, and then putting the paper back into the drawer.
8) Following this, the man in the blue jacket retrieves a fifth piece of paper with 'You Dickhead' written on it, shows it to the camera, and then puts the paper back into the drawer.
9) The man in the black hoodie retrieves a sixth piece of paper with 'I Know' written on it, shows it to the camera, and then puts the paper back into the drawer.
10) Lastly, the man in the blue jacket retrieves a seventh piece of paper with 'NOSE' written on it, shows it to the camera, and then puts the paper back into the drawer.
11) Throughout these actions, they stand next to each other, talking and gesturing with their hands, which suggests that the retrieval and display of the papers are part of their ongoing interaction.
12) At some point, the man in the black hoodie opens his hoodie, revealing a yellow shirt underneath, adding another layer to their interaction.
