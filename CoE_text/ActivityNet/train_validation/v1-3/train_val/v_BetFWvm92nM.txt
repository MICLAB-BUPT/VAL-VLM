1) The video shows two girls in a bathroom, one wearing glasses and the other with red hair, both holding a bottle of mouthwash, and they are discussing it.
2) The girl with red hair, who is also wearing a black shirt, proceeds to gargle the mouthwash, which causes the other girl, who is wearing a white t-shirt, to watch her.
3) After gargling, they both spit out the mouthwash into the sink, causing them to continue their oral rinse routine.
4) The girl with red hair then bends over the sink, possibly rinsing her mouth or spitting out more of the mouthwash, while the girl without glasses stands up and moves around the bathroom.
5) Meanwhile, the girl in the white t-shirt opens her mouth wide, and the girl in the black shirt pours mouthwash into her mouth, leading to the girl in the white t-shirt gargling the mouthwash and spitting it out.
6) Subsequently, the girl in the black shirt takes a sip of mouthwash from the bottle, and they both continue to talk and laugh while drinking the mouthwash, causing the scene to end with both girls standing near the sink, seemingly finishing their oral rinse routine.
