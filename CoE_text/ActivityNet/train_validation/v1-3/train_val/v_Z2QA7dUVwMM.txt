1) The video begins with a close-up of a black tire placed on a wooden surface, with a person's hand visible.
2) The person then removes the hubcap from the wheel, which causes the wheel and tire to be more accessible for maintenance.
3) Next, the person handles various objects, including a black wheel rim and an orange bottle, possibly containing lubricant or cleaning solution, to prepare for the application.
4) The person applies the liquid from the bottle onto the tire's surface, ensuring it is evenly spread, which helps in reducing friction and making subsequent steps easier.
5) After applying the lubricant, the person uses a tool to remove the lug nuts and take off the tire, enabling a more thorough inspection and maintenance.
6) The person then applies more lubricant to the wheel and tire, ensuring thorough coverage, which further facilitates the maintenance process and protects the tire.
7) Finally, they reattach the hubcap to the wheel, completing the maintenance process, which secures the wheel and restores its appearance.
