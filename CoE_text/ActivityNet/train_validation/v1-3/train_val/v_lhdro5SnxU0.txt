1) The video starts with a man sitting on the stairs, talking to the camera.
2) He then moves to a kitchen sink and begins cleaning it, which causes him to use a spray bottle to apply cleaner and a cloth or sponge for scrubbing.
3) After spraying and scrubbing, he rinses the sink with water from the faucet, causing the removal of both the cleaner and the dirt.
4) Following the rinse, the man dries the sink with a towel, leading to a clean and dry sink.
5) Finally, he turns off the faucet and the video ends with him back on the stairs, continuing his conversation.
