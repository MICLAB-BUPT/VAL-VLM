1) The person, dressed in a red jacket and gloves to stay warm in the cold, snowy environment, uses a blue and black snow brush with an extendable handle to clear snow from their vehicle.
2) The extendable feature of the 'SNOWJOE' branded snow brush allows the user to reach high places on the car, such as the roof, without needing a ladder, causing the process to be more efficient and convenient.
3) After clearing the thick layer of snow from the roof, the person moves on to scrape the windshield, side windows, and rear window, further demonstrating the versatility and functionality of the tool.
4) Once the snow is cleared, the person retracts the extendable handle for easier storage, and shows that the lightweight (1.2 lbs) tool can be conveniently hung on a wall hook or stored in the trunk of the car, indicating its practicality for regular use during winter conditions.
