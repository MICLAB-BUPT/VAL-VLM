1) A young girl with long hair is in a room with tiled flooring, wearing a black top with pink and white designs, paired with a pink tutu skirt. She's barefoot and energetically playing with a pink hula hoop.
2) The girl attempts to spin the hula hoop around her waist but struggles initially, causing her to try different techniques, including spinning it above her head and around her arms, but the hoop keeps falling.
3) Despite the challenges, she remains enthusiastic and determined, which leads her to try various moves like spinning the hoop between her legs and around her neck.
4) Her actions are playful and show a mix of concentration and enjoyment as she interacts with the hula hoop, eventually resulting in her being able to spin the hula hoop around her waist while moving her arms and legs rhythmically.
