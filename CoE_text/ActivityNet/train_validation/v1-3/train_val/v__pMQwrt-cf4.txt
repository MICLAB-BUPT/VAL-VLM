1) The video begins with a title screen displaying "Installation Instructions" and the brand name "superfloor," which then transitions to a close-up of a green package labeled "superfloor," detailing its contents and usage.
2) This is followed by a scene where a hand holding a metal ruler measures a floor surface, causing the individual to understand the dimensions needed for the installation.
3) The person then kneels on the floor, using a tool to cut a piece of underlay material according to the measured dimensions, ensuring it will fit the space.
4) After cutting, the individual places and adjusts the underlay on the floor, pressing down to ensure it adheres properly and fits well, which causes a stable base for the carpet.
5) Finally, the person unrolls a large sheet of carpet over the underlay, carefully positioning it to cover the entire floor area, completing the installation process.
