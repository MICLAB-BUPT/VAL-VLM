2) She then picks up a broom and sweeps the floor, causing the removal of any loose dirt or debris before mopping.
3) Next, she pours some of the green cleaning solution from a bottle labeled 'Green' onto the mop head, which enables her to apply the solution effectively to the floor.
4) With the mop now ready, she begins mopping the floor, moving back and forth across the wooden surface, ensuring that all areas are covered with the cleaning solution.
