1) The woman begins by mixing graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar to form the crust, which causes the creation of a base for the s'mores ice cream cake.
2) She then presses this mixture into a springform pan and bakes it, causing the crust to set and become firm.
3) Next, she melts chocolate and whips Cool Whip, leading to the preparation of two key layers for the cake.
4) These ingredients are layered with the baked crust, resulting in the formation of the cake's structure.
5) Miniature marshmallows are dipped in milk and placed on top of the whipped cream layer, causing an enhancement in the texture and flavor of the dessert.
6) Finally, the dessert is baked again until the marshmallows are toasted, leading to the completion of the beautifully decorated s'mores ice cream cake.
