This transition indicates that the next part of the video will focus on the pet grooming process at this specific location.
3) Inside Pappy's Pet Lodge, the groomer, who is the same woman mentioned in the second answer, is seen brushing, bathing, and trimming the dogs' fur. The use of these grooming tools by the groomer causes the dogs to appear calm and cooperative during the process, highlighting the skill and care of the groomer.
