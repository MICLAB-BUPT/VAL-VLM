1) A young girl in a pink shirt and black shorts is playing on the monkey bars at a playground.
2) She starts by hanging from the first bar, then swings her body forward to grab the next bar, which causes her to move across the bars.
3) She continues swinging her body forward and backward as she moves across the bars, using her arms to pull herself up and over each bar, and her legs to push herself forward.
4) This coordinated effort of swinging, pulling, and pushing allows her to continue moving until she reaches the end of the monkey bars.
