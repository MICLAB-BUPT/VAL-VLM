1) A group of people wearing blue helmets and life jackets are rafting on a river with strong currents, causing the raft to bounce and tilt as it moves through the turbulent water.
2) The participants are paddling vigorously to navigate through the rapids, which are surrounded by rocky terrain, causing the raft to be tossed around by the strong currents.
3) Due to the intensity of the rapids and the force of the water, some passengers fall out of the raft, but the remaining individuals continue to paddle and steer the raft towards a calmer section of the river.
