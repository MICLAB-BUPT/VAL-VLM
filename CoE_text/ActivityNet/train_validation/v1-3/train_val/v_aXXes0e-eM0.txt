1) The video opens with two children in a garage, one sitting in a red toy car and the other standing beside it. The child in the car, a boy wearing a blue jacket, is holding a snack bag and eating chips, while the other child, a girl, is dressed in a superhero costume and standing next to him.
2) The scene shifts to show the girl in the superhero costume attempting to hit a pinata shaped like a red car, which is suspended from the ceiling. The girl swings at the pinata multiple times but misses.
3) The camera then pans back to the initial scene of the two children by the toy car, where now there's also another boy wearing a grey hoodie who is standing on the floor, holding a stick, and hitting the pinata.
4) The first boy, still in his blue jacket, gets out of the toy car and stands next to the pinata, watching the second boy hit it.
5) The girl in the superhero costume tries again to hit the pinata, this time successfully breaking it open.
6) The video concludes with the girl in the superhero costume looking up at the broken pinata, surrounded by adults who are watching the event unfold.
