2) After zipping up the backpack and adjusting its straps, he walks away from the camera towards a wooded area, indicating his readiness and determination for the upcoming activity.
3) As he enters the woods, he begins running along a dirt path surrounded by trees and greenery, leading him to navigate through rocky terrain and uneven paths.
