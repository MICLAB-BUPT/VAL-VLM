1) The man, wearing a white t-shirt with black stripes on the sleeves and black shorts, is in a gym setting.
2) He is seated on a rowing machine, which causes him to hold onto the handle attached to a cable running through a pulley system.
3) As he pulls the handle towards his body, his legs extend forward, and as he pushes the handle away, his legs bend backward, causing a repetitive motion that exercises his muscles.
4) This action of pulling the handle while keeping his legs straight and feet flat on the footrests, and then extending his arms forward, is repeated throughout his exercise session.
