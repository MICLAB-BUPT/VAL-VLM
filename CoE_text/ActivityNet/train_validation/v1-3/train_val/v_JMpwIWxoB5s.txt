1) The video begins with a close-up of a kitchen counter, where ingredients and utensils are laid out, setting the stage for the preparation.
2) This setup causes the scene to transition to a colorful background introducing 'Noreen's Kitchen' and announcing 'National Lemonade Day', which leads into the demonstration of making 'Old Fashioned Lemonade'.
3) The hand arranging lemon slices on the cutting board then causes the lemons to be cut and placed in a pitcher filled with ice, initiating the actual process of making the lemonade.
4) Pouring water into the pitcher with ice and lemons, followed by the addition of lemon juice from a jar, causes the mixture to be ready for stirring.
5) Stirring the mixture causes it to blend, resulting in the lemonade being poured into glasses that have been filled with ice.
6) Finally, garnishing the glasses with lemon slices and adding straws enhances the presentation, causing the video to conclude with a promotional screen for 'Noreen's Kitchen' and an advertisement for 'Chicken Deluxe'.
