1) The woman gathers her hair and divides it into two sections, which is the initial step to create a braid hairstyle.
2) She twists both sections of hair outward, causing the strands to be prepped for interlocking.
3) The twisting of the hair sections towards the outside causes them to be ready for braiding, leading her to interlock these two twisted sections.
4) After interlocking, she continues braiding the rest of her hair, resulting in a complete braid.
5) The braid is secured with a hair tie, ensuring that the hairstyle stays in place.
6) To add volume, she pulls out small pieces from the inside of each section, which causes the braid to look fuller and more aesthetically pleasing.
7) In one version, the braid is further accessorized with a floral headband and her bangs are styled with a flat iron, while in another, she styles her hair back and poses with a small dog, indicating the completion and personalization of the hairstyle.
