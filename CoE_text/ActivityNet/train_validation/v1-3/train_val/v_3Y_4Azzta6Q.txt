1) The video begins with a black screen that transitions to a title card reading 'Sexy panty cake' in elegant white cursive font against a black background, which causes the scene to shift to a close-up of a heart-shaped cake on a black plate.
2) A hand is seen smoothing the surface of the cake, ensuring it's even, which leads to the focus moving to a pink fondant piece being rolled out on a wooden table.
3) The pink fondant is then cut into a specific shape using a metal cutter, and this action results in the pink fondant being carefully placed onto the heart-shaped cake, aligning it precisely.
4) Next, a thin strip of black fondant is rolled out and smoothed, and after a purple brush is used to give it a glossy finish, this strip is placed over the pink fondant on the cake, completing the decoration process.
5) The hands are also shown pressing the cake into a mold and using a rolling pin to flatten a piece of red fondant, causing the red fondant to be carefully placed onto the cake, ensuring it is evenly spread and shaped.
6) The video concludes with a final shot of the fully decorated cake, showcasing the intricate details of the underwear design.
