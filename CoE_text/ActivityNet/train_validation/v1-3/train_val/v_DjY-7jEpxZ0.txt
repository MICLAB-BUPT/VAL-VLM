1) The video shows a group of people gathered in a room, with one person standing in the center holding a large wrapped gift.
2) The gift is suspended from the ceiling by a rope, and in another scenario, a woman is standing in the middle of the room, surrounded by a group of people, holding a stick to hit the large wrapped gift hanging from the ceiling.
3) In the first scenario, the person in the center swings the gift around and around, which causes the other people to watch and cheer.
4) In the second scenario, the woman hits the gift, which also causes the people around her to smile and laugh, indicating they are entertained.
5) Both actions (swinging and hitting) towards the gift eventually cause it to break open, revealing what's inside.
