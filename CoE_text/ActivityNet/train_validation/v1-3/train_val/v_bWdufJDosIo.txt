1) The video begins with a title screen, which causes the introduction of the brand and product, 'Vision Wallcoverings' and 'Relax Wallpaper is easy!'.
2) This introduction then leads to a scene transition, where a woman in a red and black top holds wallpaper rolls, while a man in the background prepares materials, causing them to start the wallpapering process.
3) The woman speaks to the camera and demonstrates the smoothing out of wallpaper on a wall, which causes her to use a tool to trim the excess paper around the edges.
4) Simultaneously, the man's preparation of the wallpaper by cutting it to size using a utility knife and his careful measuring and cutting cause him to apply the wallpaper to the upper part of the wall near a wooden door frame, ensuring a precise fit.
5) The meticulous attention to detail, such as aligning and smoothing the wallpaper, causes the wallpaper to adhere properly to the wall.
6) The completion of the wallpapering process, including the final touches and explanations, causes the video to conclude with the woman speaking again, followed by a screen displaying contact information for Vision Wallcoverings in Australia and New Zealand.
