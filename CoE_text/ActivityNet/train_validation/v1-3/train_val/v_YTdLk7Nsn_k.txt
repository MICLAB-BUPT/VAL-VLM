1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'Professionals' in black text on a white background, which then transitions to another title screen with the text 'That are right on target!', followed by an image of the United States map with the American flag colors and the words 'UNITED ASSEMBLERS' above it.
2) This causes the next title screen to appear, reading 'Bike Assembly and Repair The Crank Removing Tool', leading into the main content where a man in a gray sweater (and glasses, as per Answer 2) is seen standing in a workshop, holding a crank removing tool, which is blue.
3) Holding the blue tool, the man demonstrates how to use it on a bicycle crank, showing close-ups of his hands as he works, which leads him to explain the process while working on the bike, using various tools from the pegboard behind him.
4) As a result, the man moves to work on a bicycle mounted on a stand, using the blue tool to adjust or fix parts of the bike's crank mechanism, keeping the focus on his hands as he manipulates the tool and the bike components.
5) The demonstration and explanation cause the video to conclude with a final title screen that says 'Professionals' again, followed by a blank white screen.
