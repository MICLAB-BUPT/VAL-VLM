1) A man in a dark t-shirt and blue jeans is mopping a hardwood floor in a living room, which causes him to start by pouring a cleaning solution from a bottle into a bucket.
2) After pouring the cleaning solution, he dips the mop into the bucket to soak it thoroughly, which leads to him wringing out the excess water.
3) Once the mop is wrung out, he proceeds to mop the floor, moving back and forth across the room, which results in the cleaning of the hardwood floor.
