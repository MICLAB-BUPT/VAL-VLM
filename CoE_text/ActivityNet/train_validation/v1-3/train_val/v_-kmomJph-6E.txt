1) In a sunny outdoor setting with green grass and white wooden structures, two individuals engage in a playful wrestling match, causing the environment to have a casual and relaxed atmosphere.
2) The impromptu nature of their interaction, characterized by energetic and exaggerated movements for comedic effect, causes one person, wearing black shorts and a black t-shirt, to lift the other person, who is wearing grey shorts and a black t-shirt, off the ground.
3) After lifting, the individual then proceeds to throw the lifted person onto a white board leaning against one of the buildings, continuing the spontaneous moment of fun.
