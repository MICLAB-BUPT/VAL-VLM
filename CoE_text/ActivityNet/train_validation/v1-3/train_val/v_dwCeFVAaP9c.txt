1) The video begins with a man kneeling on the floor, preparing to install carpet tiles, which causes him to be in the right position to handle and position the tiles.
2) The man carefully places and adjusts the tiles to ensure they are properly aligned and secured, causing the installation process to progress smoothly.
3) He then proceeds to clean one of the tiles using a cleaning solution and a cloth, ensuring it is thoroughly wiped down, which causes the tiles to be free of dirt or debris.
4) Finally, he uses a vacuum cleaner to clean the entire carpeted area, making sure it is free of any remaining debris or dirt, which results in a clean and well-installed carpet.
