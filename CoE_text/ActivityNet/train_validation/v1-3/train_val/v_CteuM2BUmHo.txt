1) A man, wearing a white shirt, gray shorts, and a white cap, is seen kneeling on the ground.
2) The man is using a tool to smooth out a surface, likely concrete or asphalt, which causes him to move the tool back and forth across the surface with precision.
3) His diligent work on the concrete surface causes the camera to zoom in on his face, capturing his focused expression.
4) The scene then shifts to a close-up of a website address, "www.stoneageconcretetools.com", which suggests that the video is promoting the tools used by the man.
5) The video ends with the man still working on the concrete surface, continuing the action of smoothing it.
