1) The two individuals are engaged in a manual labor task on a rooftop, which is the removal of old roofing material.
2) The environment's sunny and clear conditions cause the workers to be in bright lighting, with shadows cast on the ground, indicating it is a good day for outdoor work.
3) Because they are performing physical labor, the workers wear casual work attire and gloves for protection, which is necessary for their safety and comfort during the task.
4) One man uses a shovel to lift and break up the material, causing the other man to assist by holding and pulling the material away from the roof, as part of their coordinated effort to remove the old roofing.
5) The action of removing the old material causes the rooftop to become cluttered with debris, creating a visible contrast between the old and the new, clean sections of the roof.
6) The presence of residential structures and trees in the background suggests that this activity is taking place in a suburban area, which is the setting where the men are working.
