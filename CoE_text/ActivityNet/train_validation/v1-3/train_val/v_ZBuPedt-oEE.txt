1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'L.G. Productions' in white, followed by 'How To Make A Blizzard Cake' and 'Behind The Scenes'.
2) It then transitions to a kitchen setting where a person in a black shirt is seen preparing a cake.
3) The person places a metal ring mold on a counter or a white plate, which causes them to have a defined area for building the cake.
4) They add a layer of white frosting using a machine or a spatula inside the mold, ensuring that the base of the cake is covered.
5) Adding a layer of crushed nuts or brown crumble mixture from a container on top of the frosting creates texture and flavor, which leads to the next step.
6) They continue to add more layers of frosting and crushed nuts or brown crumble, ensuring an even distribution, which results in a layered effect in the cake.
7) Placing another metal ring mold on top of the existing layer allows for the creation of a taller cake, and smoothing out the frosting around the edges ensures a neat appearance.
8) Removing the top mold and applying more frosting with a spatula prepares the cake for the final decorative touches.
9) The cake is placed into a refrigerator, causing it to freeze, which makes it easier to handle and decorate.
10) Once frozen, the cake is removed from the refrigerator, and additional frosting is applied around the edges, leading to a smoother surface for decoration.
11) Decorating the cake with whipped cream and crushed nuts or adding a decorative border of frosting around the edge, along with placing a layer of brown crumble mixture on top, completes the cake's aesthetic.
12) Finally, they add a chocolate drizzle over the whipped cream and crushed nuts, completing the decoration process, which gives the cake its final look.
