1) A young girl in a pink striped shirt is baking cupcakes in a kitchen, which causes her to gather the necessary ingredients.
2) She pours ingredients into a bowl, which causes her to mix them with a whisk.
3) After mixing, she uses a red spatula to transfer the batter into a muffin tin, which leads her to place the tin into an Easy-Bake oven.
4) Placing the tin into the oven causes her to wait for 10 minutes before checking on the cupcakes.
5) Once the cupcakes are baked, this causes her to remove the tin from the oven and then use a pink spatula to transfer the cupcakes onto a plate.
6) Transferring the cupcakes onto a plate causes her to taste one of the cupcakes, which appears to please her with the result.
