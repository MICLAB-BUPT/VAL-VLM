4) The camera focusing on the lower body movements captures the precise footwork required for this drumming technique, thereby highlighting the mechanics of the drum pedals as they are used.
5) The demonstration of the use of a double stroke kick drum technique on the drum set, with an emphasis on the foot movements and the precision and rhythm with which the individual strikes the drum head, causes the viewer to understand the skill involved in this specific drumming method.
6) The video concludes with a black screen displaying the text 'Check Out' followed by three URLs, which is intended to direct the viewer to additional resources or information about the drummer.
