1) The video shows a person working on a slate roof, removing nails and adjusting the slates.
2) The person uses a chisel to pry up the nail, which causes the nail to become loose from its position in the roof.
3) After the nail is pried up, the person then uses a hammer to drive the nail further into the roof, causing the nail to be completely removed.
4) This process of using the chisel and hammer to remove nails is repeated several times, leading to all the nails being removed from that section of the roof.
5) In addition to removing nails, the person also uses a metal tool to adjust the position of the slates, ensuring the roof's structure and appearance are maintained.
