1) The video begins with a close-up of a kitchen stove where a black frying pan is placed, and ingredients like butter, chopped onions, and beaten eggs are visible on the countertop next to the stove.
2) A person wearing a red sleeve starts by melting butter in the pan, which causes the butter to spread and coat the bottom of the pan, preparing it for cooking.
3) The person then adds chopped onions to the melted butter, which causes the onions to begin sautéing. The onions are cooked until they become translucent.
4) Next, the person pours beaten eggs into the pan, spreading them evenly over the onions. This action mixes the eggs with the onions and initiates the cooking process of the eggs.
5) As the eggs cook, they are gently stirred and folded using a wooden spatula, which helps to ensure that the eggs cook evenly and mix well with the onions.
6) The eggs are cooked until mostly set but still slightly runny, at which point the person places a lid on the pan to allow the eggs to finish cooking, causing the remaining liquid to be absorbed and the omelet to fully set.
7) Once done, the person transfers the cooked eggs onto a white plate with a cartoon design, ready to be served, completing the cooking process.
