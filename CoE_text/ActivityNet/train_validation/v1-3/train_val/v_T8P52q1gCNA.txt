1) The video begins with an orange screen displaying 'Baking LDJ Kitchen' and a small cake icon, which transitions to a close-up of banana choco cookies on a plate, setting the context for the baking tutorial.
2) This is followed by a white screen listing the ingredients for the recipe, informing viewers about what they will need, which causes the preparer to start mashing bananas in a bowl.
3) After mashing the bananas, the addition of sugar, soybean milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon powder into the bowl causes the mixture to become more flavorful and well-combined.
4) The introduction of flour (and baking soda as mentioned in Answer 2) into the wet mixture causes the dough to form, providing the necessary structure for the cookies.
5) Adding chocolate chips to the dough causes it to become speckled with bits of chocolate, enhancing both the texture and taste of the future cookies.
6) Stirring the mixture until smooth causes the ingredients to be evenly distributed, ensuring that each cookie will have a consistent composition.
7) Portioning the dough onto a baking sheet and shaping it into small balls prepares the cookies for even baking, which when placed in the oven at 200°C for 15-20 minutes, causes the cookies to bake and turn golden-brown.
8) The final product, shown as golden-brown cookies with melted chocolate chips, accompanied by sliced bananas and a red sauce, is a direct result of the precise baking process, concluding the demonstration.
9) The video ends with a thank you message on an orange background, signaling the end of the tutorial and expressing gratitude to the viewers.
