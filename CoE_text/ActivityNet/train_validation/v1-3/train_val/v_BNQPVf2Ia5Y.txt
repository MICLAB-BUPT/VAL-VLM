1) A man wearing a plaid shirt, jeans, and a baseball cap is trimming bushes in front of a house.
2) He uses an electric hedge trimmer to shape the bushes, moving around them to ensure even trimming, which causes the bushes to be shaped evenly.
3) The man works methodically, focusing on different sections of the bushes, occasionally bending down to reach lower areas, which allows him to trim all parts of the bushes, including the lower areas.
4) As he trims, leaves and trimmed branches fall to the ground, indicating that his action of trimming is causing debris to accumulate.
