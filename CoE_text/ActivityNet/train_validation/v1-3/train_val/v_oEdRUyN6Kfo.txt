1) A young child is playing with a large black dog in a spacious, well-lit living room.
2) The child, wearing a white top and dark pants, is holding a colorful hula hoop and attempts to place the hoop around the dog's neck, but it slips off, causing the child to try again.
3) This time, the child successfully places the hoop around the dog's neck, which causes the dog to remain calm and unbothered, indicating a comfortable relationship between them.
4) The girl is laughing and having fun, even though initially the dog was not interested in going through the hula hoop.
