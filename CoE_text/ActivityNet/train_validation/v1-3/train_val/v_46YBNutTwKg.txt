1) The family, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, is decorating a Christmas tree in their warmly lit living room, which has a cozy ambiance with festive decorations and a fireplace.
2) The father, wearing camouflage pants, stands on a chair to reach the top of the tree, causing him to be able to place lights on the higher branches, while the mother, dressed in a blue shirt, assists him from below by handing ornaments from a green box on the floor.
3) The son, in a black shirt, helps by holding the tree steady, ensuring it remains stable as the father reaches for the higher parts, and later picks up a red box from the floor, likely containing more decorations.
4) The daughter, also in a blue shirt, joins in by handing ornaments to her parents, contributing to the even distribution of decorations around the tree.
5) As they decorate, the family members move around the tree, adjusting lights and ornaments, which leads to the creation of a festive atmosphere and the completion of their task, marked by a 'Merry Christmas 2012!' graphic.
