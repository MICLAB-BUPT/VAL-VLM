1) A man in a blue shirt is seen assembling a ski waxing bench, which causes him to carefully place wooden planks and metal components to form the structure of the bench.
2) After forming the structure, he adjusts the components, ensuring they are securely fastened, which leads to the setup of a stable and properly aligned bench.
3) The man then places a ski on the bench, aligning it with the metal components, which allows him to demonstrate how the ski can be securely held in place using an oar lock and a 1/8" steel pin.
4) He uses a yellow tool to make precise adjustments to the ski's position, which ensures the ski is properly aligned and stable.
5) Finally, he secures the ski in place using a clamp mechanism, which results in the ski being firmly attached to the bench, ready for waxing or maintenance.
