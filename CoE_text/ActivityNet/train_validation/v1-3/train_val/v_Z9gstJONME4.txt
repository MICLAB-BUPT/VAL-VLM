1) The video shows a man in a gym setting, initially performing a bench press exercise with a weight plate while lying on a blue and black bench, wearing a blue shirt and light-colored pants. This action is to strengthen his upper body, particularly the chest, shoulders, and triceps.
2) After completing the bench press, the man transitions to performing sit-ups, still in his blue shirt but now in gray pants, holding the same or a different weight plate. He lies on the bench, repeatedly lifting his upper body towards his knees, engaging his abdominal muscles. This change in activity is to further work out, this time targeting his core muscles for strength and endurance.
