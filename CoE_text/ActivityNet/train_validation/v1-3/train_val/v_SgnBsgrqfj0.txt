1) The video starts with a person sitting at a table, holding a bottle of lemonade. This setup indicates the beginning of the preparation process.
2) They proceed to pour the lemonade into a funnel placed on top of a large plastic jug, which is done to direct the liquid without spilling, and this action initiates the mixing phase.
3) The person then adds a white substance from a container into the jug through the funnel, likely to sweeten or alter the flavor, causing a change in the composition of the mixture.
4) After that, they pour water from a measuring cup into the jug using the funnel, diluting the mixture to achieve the desired concentration.
5) In another scenario, after pouring the lemonade, the woman adds ice cubes from a bowl, intending to cool down the drink, leading to a refreshing outcome.
6) She stirs the mixture with a spoon, ensuring the ingredients are well combined, which contributes to a uniform taste throughout the drink.
7) The woman continues to pour more lemonade into the container, increasing the volume and intensity of the lemonade flavor, adjusting it to her preference.
8) Finally, in both scenarios, they secure the lid onto the jug, sealing the contents inside, and shake it vigorously, which causes the ingredients to mix thoroughly, completing the preparation of the drink.
