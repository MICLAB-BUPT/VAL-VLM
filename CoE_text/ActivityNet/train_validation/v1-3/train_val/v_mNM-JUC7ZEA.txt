1) The video showcases a step-by-step process of repairing a leaking roof vent pipe, starting with the removal of the old vent pipe and preparation of the area for a new one, which is necessary to ensure a proper installation.
2) The man in the blue jacket installs a new black rubber gasket around the base of the white PVC pipe, ensuring it is properly aligned and secured, causing the base to be watertight and preventing future leaks.
3) He uses a tool to cut the excess material from the gasket and applies a sealant around its edges, which further enhances the waterproofing of the installation.
4) Next, he places a metal flashing piece over the gasket, securing it with screws, providing additional protection against water intrusion and reinforcing the structure.
5) Finally, he applies more sealant around the base of the pipe and the flashing, ensuring a tight seal, which is the final step in making sure that the repair is fully watertight.
6) Throughout the video, the men work methodically, demonstrating each step clearly, and they communicate and collaborate effectively, showing teamwork and attention to detail, which causes the repair to be carried out efficiently and correctly.
