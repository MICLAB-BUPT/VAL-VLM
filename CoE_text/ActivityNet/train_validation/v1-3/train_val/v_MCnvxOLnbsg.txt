1) The video shows a person, identified as a man, beginning the process of washing his car which is parked in a residential area, specifically in the driveway, during sunset.
2) The man starts by spraying water on the car using a hose, causing the car's surface to become wet, which prepares it for cleaning.
3) This action is followed by the man using a yellow sponge to clean the windshield and hood, and scrubbing the car's surface, leading to the removal of dirt and grime.
4) After scrubbing, he rinses off the soap with the hose, causing the soapy water and loosened dirt to be washed away, further cleaning the car.
5) The man then uses a green cloth (or towel in the second answer, interpreted as the same tool for drying), to wipe down and dry the car's surface, ensuring that all parts of the car are cleaned thoroughly and no water marks are left behind.
6) Once the cleaning process is completed, the man gets into the driver's seat and starts the car, indicating the end of the car washing activity.
7) The scene concludes with the car driving away from the curb as night falls, signifying the completion of the event.
