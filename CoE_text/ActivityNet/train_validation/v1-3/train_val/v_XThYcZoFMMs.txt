1) The video begins with a person preparing to bake a butter cake, laying out necessary ingredients like eggs, flour, sugar, and butter on a kitchen counter, which is the initial step that sets the stage for the baking process.
2) The act of adding these ingredients into a mixing bowl attached to a red stand mixer causes the person to start the mixing phase, where they turn on the electric mixer to blend the ingredients into a smooth batter, an essential step in achieving the right consistency for the cake.
3) After the batter is prepared, it is poured into a round baking pan lined with parchment paper, which prepares the cake for the baking process, ensuring it does not stick to the pan and bakes evenly.
4) Placing the filled baking pan into the oven initiates the baking phase, causing the cake to transform from a liquid batter into a solid, golden brown cake, as the heat from the oven cooks the ingredients and causes them to rise and set.
5) Once the cake has finished baking and turned golden brown, the person takes it out of the oven, leading to the final step of allowing the baked cake to cool on a wire rack, which helps in setting the structure of the cake and making it ready for serving.
