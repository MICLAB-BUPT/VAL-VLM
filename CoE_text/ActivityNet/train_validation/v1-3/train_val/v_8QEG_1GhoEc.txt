1) The video starts with a man in a blue shirt and khaki pants standing in front of a building, surrounded by greenery, which causes him to be the main focus of the demonstration.
2) He is then seen kneeling next to a tree, spreading mulch around its base, which leads to him demonstrating proper mulching techniques.
3) Another man in a yellow vest and white hard hat joins him, using a wheelbarrow to transport the mulch, thereby assisting in the task.
4) They work together to spread the mulch evenly around the tree, causing the area around the tree's base to be fully covered.
5) The man in the blue shirt inspects the mulching work done, ensuring it covers the soil completely, which results in a thorough and professional job.
6) The scene shifts to the man in the blue shirt standing next to a large green truck with the text 'DAVEY' on it, leading to him explaining something, gesturing towards the truck, which suggests he is providing additional information or context about the service or company.
