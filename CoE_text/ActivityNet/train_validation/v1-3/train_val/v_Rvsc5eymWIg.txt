1) The man in a blue uniform and gloves starts by using a power tool to remove lug nuts from a car wheel, which causes the wheel to be detached from the car.
2) After detaching the wheel, he mounts the tire onto a rim using a specialized machine, causing the tire and rim to be properly aligned and secured.
3) With the tire mounted on the rim, he then places the wheel on a balancing machine, which allows him to check and adjust the balance of the wheel.
4) The person uses a tool to add or adjust the wheel's balance weights, ensuring the wheel spins smoothly without wobbling, which results in a digital readout of '0.00' indicating perfect balance.
5) After achieving the perfect balance, the wheel is re-attached to the car, leading to the final shot showing the car driving smoothly on a road with greenery in the background, indicating the successful completion of the tire maintenance and balancing process.
