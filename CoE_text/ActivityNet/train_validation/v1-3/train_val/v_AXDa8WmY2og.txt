1) The video showcases a dog grooming session where a person in a pink shirt and white apron is seen trimming the fur of a Shih Tzu dog with long hair, which causes the groomer to use electric clippers to trim the fur around the dog's body.
2) After using the electric clippers, the groomer then uses scissors to carefully trim the fur around the dog's face, ensuring precision and neatness, which leads to the handling of the dog's head being held steady while cutting the fur.
3) In addition to trimming, the person also uses a comb to brush the dog's fur, making it neat and tidy, which results in the overall process being meticulous and focused on detail.
4) Throughout the process, the person handles the dog gently and carefully, ensuring the dog remains calm and comfortable, which contributes to the smooth execution of the grooming session.
5) The video ends with a black screen displaying the text 'Thank you for watching' followed by 'Richmond Hill ON Dog Grooming Salon Pet Grooming Studio', which signifies the conclusion of the grooming demonstration.
