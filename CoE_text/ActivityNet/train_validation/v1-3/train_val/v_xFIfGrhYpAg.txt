1) The video takes place in an indoor ice hockey rink during a practice session, which causes the environment to be well-lit with artificial lighting and have advertisements along the boards.

4) The sense of motion as players skate across the frame, and the focus shifting between the child and the adults, enhances the depiction of an active and dynamic practice session.
