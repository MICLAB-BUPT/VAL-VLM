1) A young girl is playing on a wooden playground structure in a backyard, wearing a pink jacket, blue shirt with text, white pants, and red boots.
2) The girl starts by standing on the platform of the structure, then grabs onto a horizontal bar above her head, which causes her to begin swinging back and forth.
3) As she continues to swing, she moves her legs up and down, enabling her to maintain and possibly increase the momentum of her swinging.
4) The girl holds onto the bars with both hands, allowing her to move from one side of the structure to the other, indicating that she is enjoying herself.
