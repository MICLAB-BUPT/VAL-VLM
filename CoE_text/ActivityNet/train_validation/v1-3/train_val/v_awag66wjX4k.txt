3) The scene then shifts to a close-up where the man, now wearing blue gloves, picks up a silver tool from the bicycle handlebar, which causes him to start demonstrating how to use the tool, showing its features and functionality.
4) As he demonstrates, the man proceeds to adjust the handlebars of the bicycle, using the tool to tighten or loosen bolts, which leads to him carefully manipulating the handlebars to ensure they are properly aligned and secured.
5) Throughout the video, the focus remains on the man's hands and the bicycle handlebars, highlighting the precision and care involved in the adjustment process, and he is also seen handling a small cylindrical object, possibly a part of the bicycle's mechanism.
