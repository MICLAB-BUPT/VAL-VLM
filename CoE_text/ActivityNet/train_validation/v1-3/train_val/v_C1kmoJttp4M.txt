1) The video begins with a person in a kitchen setting, wearing a green shirt and white apron, standing next to a stove with a frying pan on it.
2) The person proceeds to crack eggs into a measuring cup, which causes them to then add milk and whisk the mixture, preparing it for cooking.
3) They melt butter in the frying pan on the stove, which leads to pouring the egg mixture into the pan.
4) Using a wooden spatula, they stir and fold the eggs as they cook, causing the eggs to form an omelet.
5) Once the eggs are cooked, this results in them sliding the omelet onto a plate and garnishing it with some greens.
