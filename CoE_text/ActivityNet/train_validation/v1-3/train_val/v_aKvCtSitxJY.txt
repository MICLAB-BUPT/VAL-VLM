1) The video shows a young girl in a pink swimsuit standing on a grassy lawn, holding a hula hoop.
2) She begins by spinning the hula hoop around her waist, which causes her to start dancing, moving her arms and legs in a rhythmic fashion while keeping the hula hoop spinning.
3) As she continues to dance and spin the hula hoop, she then lifts it above her head and spins it around her neck, demonstrating control over the hula hoop's movement.
4) She keeps manipulating the hula hoop with her hands, moving it from her waist to her neck and back again, which leads to her occasionally stopping to adjust her hair or pose for the camera.
