1) The video shows a person in a kitchen setting, wearing a graphic t-shirt with a skull design, preparing to sharpen a knife.
2) The individual begins by wetting the whetstone under running water from a faucet, which causes the whetstone to become wet and ready for the sharpening process.
3) The person then places the knife on the wet whetstone, causing the start of the sharpening action.
4) The individual holds the knife at an angle and slides it back and forth across the stone, applying pressure with his fingers, which leads to the gradual sharpening of the blade.
5) The use of water on the whetstone serves to cool and lubricate the surface during the sharpening, allowing for a smoother and more effective sharpening process.
