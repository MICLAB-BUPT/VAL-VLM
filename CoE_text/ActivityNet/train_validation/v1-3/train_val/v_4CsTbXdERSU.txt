1) The video showcases a man working on a roof, applying a black material to it. He uses a tool to spray the material onto the roof, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
2) After spraying, the man rolls out the material and presses it down firmly to secure it in place, which causes the material to start adhering to the roof surface.
3) In another method, the man applies a black strip to the roof of a house using a tool, ensuring it is properly aligned and secured.
4) Then, he uses a torch to heat the strip, causing it to melt and adhere to the roof surface more effectively.
5) He carefully smooths out the strip with his hands after heating, making sure there are no air bubbles or wrinkles, which ensures a seamless and secure application of the strip.
6) The man continues this process, whether by rolling and pressing or by heating and smoothing, moving along the roof and making sure the material or strip is properly applied and adhered.
