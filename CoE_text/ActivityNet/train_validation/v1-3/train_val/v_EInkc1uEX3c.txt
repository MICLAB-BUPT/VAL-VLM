1) The video begins with a title screen displaying the STARFLEX logo and the text 'Laying procedure for Wood plus'.
2) It then transitions to a room with a concrete floor where a person is seen sweeping the floor with a broom, which causes the removal of loose dirt and debris.
3) The person then uses a mop to clean the floor, leading to a more thorough cleaning and preparation of the surface.
4) Two individuals measure and mark the floor with a yellow measuring tape, which results in accurate dimensions for laying the wooden planks.
5) One of the individuals stirs a white substance (adhesive) in a bucket using a wooden stick, causing the adhesive to reach a suitable consistency for application.
6) The individual pours the white substance onto the floor and spreads it evenly with a trowel, thereby creating an even layer of adhesive that will hold the wooden planks.
7) The individual places wooden planks onto the adhesive-covered floor, aligning them carefully, ensuring that the planks are correctly positioned and ready for pressing down.
8) The person uses a roller to press down on the wooden planks, ensuring they are firmly attached to the floor, which leads to a secure and stable installation of the wooden flooring.
