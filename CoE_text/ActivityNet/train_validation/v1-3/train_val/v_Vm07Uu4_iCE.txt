1) The video shows a man working on a tire in a garage or workshop setting, which causes him to start the process by removing the tire from the rim using a tool.
2) After removing the tire, he places it onto a red machine, likely a tire changer or balancer, for further processing, causing him to adjust the tire's position on the machine with another tool.
3) He then operates the machine, which involves adjusting various components to secure the tire in place, leading to him using additional tools to work on the tire, possibly for repair or maintenance purposes.
4) Once the necessary work on the tire is completed, this causes him to remove the tire from the machine and place it back onto the rim.
5) Throughout the entire process, the man remains focused and meticulous, demonstrating his expertise and precision in handling the equipment and materials.
