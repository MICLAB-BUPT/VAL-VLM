1) A shirtless man in black shorts is lying on a tiled floor, performing sit-ups. 
2) His legs are bent at the knees and his feet are flat on the floor, which allows him to maintain balance and stability during the exercise.
3) He has his hands behind his head, providing support as he lifts his upper body up and down, targeting his abdominal muscles.
4) The room appears to be dimly lit, possibly in the evening or night, with some furniture visible in the background, indicating that the man is exercising at home during his leisure time.
5) There's another person's leg occasionally seen in the frame, suggesting someone else might be present, likely watching or encouraging him, which can motivate the man to continue his workout.
