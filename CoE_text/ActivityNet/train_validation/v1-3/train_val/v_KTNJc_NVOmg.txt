1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'トリミング' (Trimming) and 'Trim claws and Maru', which causes the viewer to understand the content of the video.
2) It then transitions to a close-up view of a cat lying on its back, appearing relaxed and comfortable, which leads to the camera focusing on the cat's paws, showing detailed fur texture and color variations.
3) A hand gently holds one of the cat's paws, revealing the cat's claws, which in turn results in a wider shot where the cat is lying on a person's lap covered with a light green blanket.
4) The person, wearing a blue and white striped shirt, starts trimming the cat's claws using a pair of nail clippers, ensuring to avoid cutting too close to the quick, which is the sensitive part of the claw.
5) Throughout the video, the cat remains calm and cooperative during the grooming process, leading to the conclusion of the video with a black screen displaying the word 'end' in white text.
