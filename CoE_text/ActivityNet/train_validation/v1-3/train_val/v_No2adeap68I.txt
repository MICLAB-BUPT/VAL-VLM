1) The video begins with a man in a kitchen setting, preparing to apply a door wrap.
2) He starts by cleaning the door with rubbing alcohol, ensuring it's free of dust and dirt, which causes the surface to be properly prepped for the application.
3) Next, he peels off the backing of the door wrap, about 6 inches down from the top, to initiate the application process.
4) He carefully aligns the wrap on the door, smoothing it out to remove any air bubbles or wrinkles, which ensures a smooth and professional-looking finish.
5) The man presses hard to ensure the photo text sticks well onto the door, causing the material to adhere firmly and avoid peeling or bubbling later.
6) After applying the wrap, he cuts off the extra print and removes it, resulting in a neatly trimmed and finished appearance.
7) Finally, he stands next to the door, showcasing the completed door wrap with a picturesque canal scene, which highlights the transformation from a plain to a decorated door.
