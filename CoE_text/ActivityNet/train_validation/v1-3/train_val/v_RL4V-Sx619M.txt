1) The video shows a group of people playing shuffleboard on a cruise ship, which causes the players to take turns sliding pucks across the court.
2) The aim of sliding the pucks is to land them in specific scoring zones, causing the camera to capture close-up shots of the pucks and the court markings to emphasize the precision required in the game.
3) While the game is being played, there are also scenes showing people walking along the deck, enjoying the view, which leads to the inclusion of scenic views of the ocean and the city skyline or coastline in the background.
