3) Swinging the ball back then causes the man to release it down the lane towards the pins, with his movements being fluid and controlled as he prepares to make his shot.
4) The release of the ball causes it to roll smoothly on the polished wooden surface of the lane, heading towards the pins at a speed indicated by the text '522 rpm' displayed in the bottom right corner of the frames.
