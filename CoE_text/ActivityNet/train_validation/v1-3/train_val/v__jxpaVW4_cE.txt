1) The video begins with a group of children and an adult preparing to ride a camel, which is adorned with colorful saddles and led by a handler, causing the children to get seated on the camel's back, holding onto the saddles, while the adult assists them.
2) As the camel starts walking, it causes the children to wave goodbye to the camera, leading to the camel walking through a fenced area with trees and rocks in the background.
3) The handler guiding the camel along a path, passing by other camels and people, results in the children continuing to wave as they ride, enjoying the experience.
4) The camel approaching a wooden platform where more people are waiting causes the woman, who is leading the camel, to guide it to stop.
5) This stopping action leads to the children dismounting from the camel, assisted by the woman, thus concluding the camel ride activity at the zoo.
