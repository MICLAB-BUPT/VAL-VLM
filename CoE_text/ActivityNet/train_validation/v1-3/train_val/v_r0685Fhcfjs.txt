1) The video opens with a man in a green shirt and beige pants standing on grass, holding a black bag labeled 'TORO', surrounded by trees and a house.
2) The scene transitions to him squatting next to a pile of leaves, wearing a straw hat, and text identifies him as 'Skip Richter' from 'AgriLife Extension'.
3) He stands up, walks towards the camera, and begins to spread the leaves around the base of a tree using his hands, which causes the camera to focus on his actions as he works the soil and mulch into the ground.
4) Throughout the process, he empties the contents of the 'TORO' bag onto the leaves, kneels down, picks up some leaves, and examines them closely, which leads to him seemingly explaining something about the leaves or the gardening process.
