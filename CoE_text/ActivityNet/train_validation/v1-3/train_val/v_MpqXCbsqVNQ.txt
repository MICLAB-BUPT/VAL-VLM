1) The video begins with a view of a tall building with a dome and a clock tower, set against a clear blue sky, which then transitions to a grassy field where a person in a red sports jersey is seen sitting on the grass.
2) The person stands up and walks across the field, holding a stick, which causes the scene to shift to another location where the same person is now standing in front of a fountain and a building with a tiled roof.
3) The next sequence shows a group of young men playing hurling on a grassy field, wearing different colored jerseys, some with helmets for protection, causing them to be engaged in running, hitting a small ball with sticks, and interacting with each other.
4) The game's dynamic nature, including players chasing after the ball and attempting to score goals, leads to the video capturing the intensity, excitement, and camaraderie among the players.
5) The setting changes to a different location where the person in the red jersey is again seen standing in front of a building with a tiled roof and a mural, which results in the video concluding with a black screen displaying the text "Directed and Edited by Ben Arevalo."
