1) The construction worker begins by spreading cement with a trowel to create a smooth surface, which causes the floor to be prepared for tile laying.
2) The worker uses a wooden plank as a guide to level the cement evenly across the floor, causing the surface to become flat and ready for the tiles.
3) Next, the worker mixes a liquid substance (water and cement) in a bucket and applies it onto the cemented area using a trowel, which causes the surface to have the right consistency for the tiles to adhere.
4) The worker then places square tiles onto the wet cement, ensuring they are properly aligned and secured, which causes the tiles to be set in the desired pattern.
5) The worker uses a rubber mallet to tap the tiles into place, making sure they are firmly set, which causes the tiles to be securely attached to the cement.
