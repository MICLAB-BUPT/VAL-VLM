1) The video begins with a title screen that reads 'The Making of the Birthday Cake!', which causes the scene to transition to a kitchen setting.
2) In the kitchen, a person wearing a green sweater and a ring on their left hand is seen preparing a cake, causing them to spread chocolate frosting on a round cake using a spatula.
3) The cake is placed on a silver tray, and the person carefully applies the frosting to cover the entire surface, which then leads to adding another layer of cake and more frosting, smoothing it out evenly.
4) After ensuring the frosting is evenly spread, the person pipes pink frosting onto the cake, creating decorative patterns, which in turn causes them to add more details using brown and white frosting, forming facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth.
5) Adding small chocolate pieces for eyes and a smiley face serves as the final touches, leading to a close-up of the completed cake, showcasing the intricate details and decorations.
