2) The man kneels on the floor with his feet secured by a green resistance band, causing his position to be stable and appropriate for the cable machine exercise.
3) He holds onto the cable machine's handle with both hands, extending his arms forward and then pulling them back towards his chest in a controlled motion, which allows him to perform the exercise with proper form and technique.
