1) The video starts with two men carrying a large roll of carpet into a locker room, which causes them to begin the process of installation.
2) They unroll the carpet, revealing 'WARRIORS' written on it in red and white, which leads to one man measuring and cutting the carpet while the other applies adhesive to the floor.
3) After the carpet is cut and the floor is prepared with adhesive, they carefully position the carpet, causing them to use a roller to press the carpet down firmly.
4) Using the roller to secure the carpet in place results in the completion of the installation, which leads to the final shot showing the completed carpet with the 'WARRIORS' logo prominently displayed.
