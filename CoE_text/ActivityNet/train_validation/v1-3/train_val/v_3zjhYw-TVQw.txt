1) The man, dressed in a blue polo shirt and khaki pants, is standing outdoors next to a bush, which causes him to be in a position to speak directly to the camera.
2) His standing position and the setting, which appears to be a residential backyard with a house visible in the background, cause the scene to look like an instructional or informational video about gardening or landscaping.
3) To further emphasize his points, he gestures towards the bush and the ground, which causes the viewer to focus on specific areas of interest that he is highlighting.
4) He then kneels down next to the bush covered with mulch, which allows for a closer inspection and more detailed explanation, causing his actions to become even more indicative of providing instructions or information related to the plant or the mulch.
