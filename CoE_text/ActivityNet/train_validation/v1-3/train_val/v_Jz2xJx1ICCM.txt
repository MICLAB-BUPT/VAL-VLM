1) The video shows two people arm wrestling at a table, with the person on the left wearing a blue and white shirt and the person on the right wearing a gray hoodie.
2) They are both sitting across from each other, with their arms clasped together in an arm wrestling position, and their elbows resting on the table, causing a struggle for dominance as they try to overpower each other.
3) During the match, the person on the left appears more relaxed and is winning, as their arm is closer to the table, which causes the person on the right to struggle to keep their arm up.
4) The determination of both participants is evident through their focused and intense expressions, but the superior strength or technique of the person on the left eventually leads to them pushing the other person's arm down onto the table, causing the end of the match with the person on the left as the winner.
