1) The woman in a blue dress is demonstrating the use of a green and orange spray bottle on her back, which causes her to start by holding the bottle and showing it to the camera.
2) She opens the bottle and shows the nozzle, which allows her to explain that you can pump the nozzle to dispense the sunscreen onto your skin.
3) Her explanation of the bottle's features, including its nozzle for easy application, leads her to demonstrate how to apply the sunscreen to her back using the nozzle.
4) After spraying, she rubs the sunscreen in with her hand, which illustrates her method of applying sunscreen when she can't reach her back or when she's in a hurry.
