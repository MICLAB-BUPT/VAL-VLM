1) The video starts with a title card for 'Heart Breakfast with James and Charlie presents 5 Times TV Ads Lied To You' against a red background, which causes the viewer to anticipate content related to misleading advertisements.
2) It then transitions to a bathroom setting where a woman is seen from behind, standing in front of a mirror, causing the scene to focus on her morning routine.
3) She pours mouthwash into a cup and rinses her mouth, which demonstrates the practical application of mouthwash in daily oral hygiene routines.
4) The scene then cuts to a man in a bathrobe, also in the bathroom, who mimics the woman's actions by pouring mouthwash into his mouth and rinsing, which reinforces the idea of mouthwash being a common part of a typical morning routine.
