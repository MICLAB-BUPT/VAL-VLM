1) The man, wearing a blue shirt and gloves, starts by removing old tiles using a hammer and chisel, which causes the damaged area to be exposed.
2) After exposing the damaged area, he applies a metal strip to it, ensuring that the strip is properly aligned with the existing tiles, which prepares the surface for the new tiles.
3) He then places new tiles over the metal strip, making sure they are properly aligned, which ensures a snug fit and seamless integration with the rest of the roof.
4) To secure the new tiles, he uses nails, causing them to be firmly attached to the roof, which completes the repair process.
