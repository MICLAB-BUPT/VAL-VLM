1) The woman in the video, wearing a black apron and standing behind a wooden table, begins by folding a piece of parchment paper in half, then in half again, and continues to fold it into smaller sections, including a triangle shape, which causes the parchment paper to form a circular shape when unfolded.
2) After forming the circular shape, she places the folded parchment paper onto a round cake pan, smoothing it out with her hands, which allows the parchment paper to fit over the pan's surface.
3) To ensure the parchment paper fits precisely, she removes and cuts off the excess parchment paper from around the pan with scissors, which results in a perfectly sized parchment paper circle for the cake pan.
4) Finally, she holds up the finished parchment paper circle, showing it to the camera, which demonstrates the successful completion of making a parchment paper circle.
