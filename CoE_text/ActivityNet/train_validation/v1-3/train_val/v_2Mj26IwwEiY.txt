1) The man in a blue shirt and beige pants begins by preparing the room, which includes moving furniture, covering the floor with drop cloths, and securing electrical outlets with tape. This preparation is done to protect the room and its contents from damage during the wallpaper removal process.
2) He then uses a screwdriver to unscrew the light switch and applies blue painter's tape along the edges of the wall for further protection, causing the edges and fixtures to be safeguarded against potential harm or unwanted paint.
3) To ensure that the wall is ready for the next steps, he dries the wall using a fan, which causes the surface to be suitable for applying the cleaning solution.
4) After drying, the man applies a cleaning solution to the wall with a spray bottle, which helps to loosen the adhesive behind the wallpaper, making it easier to remove.
5) For safety, he puts on safety goggles and gloves, which cause him to be protected from any splashes or scrapes during the wallpaper removal.
6) The man uses a steamer to further loosen the wallpaper, and this action, combined with the cleaning solution, makes the wallpaper more pliable and easier to peel off.
7) With the wallpaper loosened, he then proceeds to scrape off the wallpaper with a putty knife, which effectively removes the old wallpaper from the wall.
8) Once the wallpaper is fully removed, he applies a primer to the wall, which prepares and seals the surface, causing it to be ready for new wallpaper or paint.
9) In one version, after priming, the man paints the wall white, while in the other, he prepares the surface for new wallpaper installation, indicating the completion of the wallpaper removal and the readiness for the next phase of wall decoration.
10) The video concludes with the man giving a thumbs-up gesture, signifying his satisfaction with the completed task, which implies that the wallpaper removal was successful.
