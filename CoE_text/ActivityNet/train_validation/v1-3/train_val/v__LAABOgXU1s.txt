1) The video begins with a man in a workshop setting, standing next to a red tire changer machine placed on wooden pallets. The man is dressed in casual attire, including a gray t-shirt and khaki shorts.
2) He approaches the machine and starts operating it by pulling down a lever, which causes the tire to rotate. As he continues to pull the lever, the tire gradually loosens from its rim.
3) After the tire has been sufficiently loosened, the man removes the tire from the machine and places it aside.
4) The person then positions a new tire onto the tool, using the tire changing tool's lever mechanism to mount the new tire onto the rim.
5) Throughout the process, careful handling of the tire and tool ensures proper alignment and secure attachment of the new tire to the rim.
