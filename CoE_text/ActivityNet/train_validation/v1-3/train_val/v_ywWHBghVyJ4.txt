1) The man in the video, dressed in a white polo shirt and standing in front of shelves filled with various tools and ski equipment, begins by holding a red waxing iron.
2) He then proceeds to apply wax onto the ski's surface, which is placed on a workbench, causing the start of the waxing process.
3) To ensure even coverage, he uses the iron to carefully move along the length of the ski, spreading the wax evenly across the ski's base.
4) Throughout the demonstration, text overlays appear on the screen, providing tips related to waxing skis, enhancing the instructional value of the video.
