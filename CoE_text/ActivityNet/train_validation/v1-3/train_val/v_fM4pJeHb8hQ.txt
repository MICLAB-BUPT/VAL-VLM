1) The video begins with a woman with long, dark red hair seated in front of a neutral background, and a stylist dressed in black standing beside her.
2) The stylist starts by brushing the woman's hair to ensure it is smooth and tangle-free, which causes the hair to be ready for styling.
3) After brushing, the stylist sections off the top portion of the woman's hair, securing it with a clip, which allows her to focus on the remaining hair.
4) The stylist then proceeds to braid the remaining hair, creating three distinct braids that extend down the back of the woman's head. This action results in a partially completed hairstyle.
5) Throughout the process, the stylist uses her hands to manipulate the hair, ensuring each braid is tight and neat, which leads to a well-structured and visually appealing hairstyle.
6) The stylist continues to braid the hair, moving from the front to the back, resulting in a series of neat, symmetrical braids, which contributes to the overall intricate pattern of the hairstyle.
7) The video concludes with the stylist presenting the finished hairstyle, which consists of three neatly braided sections, showcasing the final result of the hairstyling session.
