1) The person is in a garage or workshop setting, which causes them to have access to the necessary tools and equipment for welding.
2) Wearing protective gear, including a welding helmet and gloves, is done to ensure safety, which allows the person to work with the high-temperature and bright light conditions produced by the welding process.
3) Kneeling on the ground and carefully guiding the torch along the metal pieces is necessary for precision, which leads to the successful joining of the two pieces of metal.
4) The action of using the welding torch to weld the metal pieces together creates sparks and flashes of light, which is a direct result of the high heat and energy involved in the welding process.
