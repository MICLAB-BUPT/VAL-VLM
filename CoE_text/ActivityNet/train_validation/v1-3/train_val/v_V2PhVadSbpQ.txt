1) The video begins with a black screen displaying white text that reads 'Mygrove' and 'Raking and collecting leaves for compost,' which causes the setting to transition to an outdoor scene.
2) In the outdoor setting, a man in a green sweater and brown pants is seen raking leaves on the ground, indicating that it is autumn due to the brown and yellow color of the leaves.
3) The presence of a tree, bushes, and a grassy area covered with fallen leaves in the background causes the man to use a rake to gather the leaves into a pile, occasionally stopping to speak or gesture towards the camera.
4) The man's action of continuously raking and speaking throughout the video leads to a close-up shot of a pile of leaves on the ground, followed by another scene of him raking.
5) The completion of the raking process and the man's actions cause the video to conclude with a black screen displaying white text that reads '© Clarence House, 2012' and 'www.princeofwales.gov.uk.'
