1) The woman starts by holding a black hair dryer and explaining the process, which causes her to begin demonstrating the blow-drying technique.
2) She then showcases various hairbrushes, including a paddle brush, round brush, denser round brush, boar bristle brush, and a long brush, each with specific uses highlighted by text overlays, which leads to her using these brushes during the demonstration.
3) The use of a white towel to dry her hair and the application of heat protectant spray are preparatory steps that cause her to section her hair before using the hair dryer with different attachments.
4) Sectioning her hair and drying each section in the opposite direction for added volume, as well as using different attachments, causes the creation of a styled look.
5) Finally, she uses cold air from the hair dryer to set the style, which results in the final result being shown, followed by a promotional screen for Sally Beauty.
