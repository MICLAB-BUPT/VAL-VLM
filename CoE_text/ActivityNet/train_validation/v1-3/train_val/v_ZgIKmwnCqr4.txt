1) The woman, wearing a pink and white striped shirt and white shorts, is helping a young child, who is wearing a purple dress and sandals, to hit a pinata.
2) The woman holds the girl's hand and guides her in swinging at the pinata, which is shaped like a guitar and colored red and blue, causing the child to attempt hitting the pinata several times.
3) Despite the repeated attempts, the pinata does not break, indicating that the force of the swings or the durability of the pinata prevents it from breaking.
4) The event takes place on a concrete patio in front of a house with a sliding glass door, and there are other people in the background, including a man in a plaid shirt and jeans, and another woman in a black hat and sunglasses, watching the activity.
