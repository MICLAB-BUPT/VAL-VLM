4) Following the text 'Take one section from each side and cross them over the center section.', she takes sections from both sides and crosses them over the center.
5) The guidance 'Add a new piece of hair to each section as you go.' causes her to continue braiding while adding new pieces of hair to each section, making the braid more defined.
6) As per the instruction 'Pull the remaining hair around your shoulder and finish with a regular braid.', she pulls the remaining hair around her shoulder and finishes with a regular braid.
7) Finally, she secures the braid with another clear elastic band and cuts off any loose ends, leading to the video concluding with a close-up of the completed braid and credits for the video production team.
