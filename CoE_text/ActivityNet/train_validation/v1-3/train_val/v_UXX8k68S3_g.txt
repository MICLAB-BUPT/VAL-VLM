1) The video begins with a close-up of a pumpkin placed on a table, which causes the person's hands to be seen drawing a face on the pumpkin using a black marker.
2) The act of drawing the face, including triangular eyes and a jagged mouth, leads to the person then using a knife to cut out the drawn shapes, starting with the eyes and then moving to the mouth.
3) As the carving progresses, cutting out the shapes causes the pumpkin's interior to be revealed, showing the seeds and pulp being removed.
4) The revelation of the pumpkin's interior and the removal of its contents cause the person to continue to carve out the remaining parts of the face, such as the nose and teeth.
5) Completing the carving of the face results in the person wiping off any excess pumpkin residue from the carved areas, leading to a completed jack-o'-lantern with a spooky face.
