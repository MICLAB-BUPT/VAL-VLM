1) The video begins with a title screen stating, 'To be successful at pool you must learn to use proper form and technique...', which causes the scene to transition to a woman in a white top and blue jeans playing pool.
2) The woman is seen leaning over the table, aiming her cue stick at the balls, which leads to the camera angle changing to show her from behind as she prepares for her shot.
3) After showing her preparation, the scene shifts back to a title screen that reads, 'Do not rush the shot and do not celebrate until after you win...', causing the woman to then be shown standing up straight, holding her cue stick, and looking towards the camera.
4) Another title screen appears with the text, 'Always stay focused and concentrate on the target,' which results in the video concluding with the woman preparing for another shot, focusing intently on the cue ball and the target ball.
5) Throughout the video, the woman is playing pool in an indoor setting, where she is seen striking the cue ball with a pool stick on a green felt pool table under artificial lighting.
