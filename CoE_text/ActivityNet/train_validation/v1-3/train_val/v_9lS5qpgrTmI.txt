1) The woman starts by brushing her hair, which prepares it for styling and removes any tangles, causing a smoother base for the braid.
2) She then sections her hair into three parts, setting up the foundation for creating a French plait, which leads to the beginning of the braiding process.
3) After completing the braid, she twists it upwards, transforming the straight braid into a circular shape that will form the basis of the bun, and secures it with a hair tie to maintain its position.
4) To finalize the hairstyle, she styles the remaining hair into a neat bun on top of her head, ensuring it is secure, which results in the completion of the French plait bun.
