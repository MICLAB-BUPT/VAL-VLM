1) A man is standing in a cluttered workshop with tools and equipment scattered around.
2) He is holding a piece of paper and talking, indicating he might be following instructions or a guide for his work.
3) The man then picks up a red object, which is likely a sanding tool, and begins to sand down a pair of skis that are clamped onto the workbench, suggesting he is preparing the skis' surface for cleaning or polishing.
4) After sanding the skis, he holds a white cloth, implying he is about to clean or polish the skis to give them a final touch.
5) The man moves around the workbench, wiping the skis with the cloth and inspecting them closely, showing his attention to detail and ensuring the job is done thoroughly.
6) Behind him, there's a red flag with a blue cross, possibly the Norwegian flag, and an American flag hanging on the wall, adding context to the setting and possibly hinting at the origin or affiliation of the skis or the person.
