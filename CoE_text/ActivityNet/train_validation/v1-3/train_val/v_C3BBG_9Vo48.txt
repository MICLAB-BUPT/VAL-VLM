1) The video begins with the person pouring sugar and vegetable oil into a bowl, which causes the foundation of the cake batter to be established.
2) Adding flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract to the bowl causes the mixture to become a complete cake batter.
3) Whisking the mixture until smooth causes the ingredients to blend thoroughly, ensuring a consistent texture in the final product.
4) Pouring the mixture into a greased dish lined with parchment paper causes the cake to have a non-stick surface for easy removal after cooking.
5) Microwaving the cake for 5 minutes causes it to bake, transforming the liquid batter into a solid, spongy cake.
6) While the cake is cooking, microwaving heavy cream until it begins to bubble causes the preparation for making the ganache to start.
7) Melting chocolate chips in the hot cream causes the creation of a smooth and glossy ganache frosting.
8) Inverting the cooked cake onto a stand and peeling off the parchment paper causes the cake to be ready for frosting.
9) Pouring the ganache over the cake and spreading it evenly with a spatula causes the cake to be covered with a rich, even layer of frosting.
10) Slicing the cake and serving it showcases the final product, causing the completion of the microwave cake-making process.
