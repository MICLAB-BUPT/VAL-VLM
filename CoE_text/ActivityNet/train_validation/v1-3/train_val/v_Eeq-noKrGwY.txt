1) A young woman with long blonde hair is standing in a bathroom, wearing an orange shirt with the word 'Gator' on it.
2) She is holding a blue object, possibly a toothbrush or dental tool, in her right hand and appears to be brushing her teeth, which causes her to tilt her head back and open her mouth wide as if gargling or rinsing her mouth.
3) The action of brushing and rinsing her teeth leads her to move around the bathroom, occasionally looking at the camera and smiling. 
4) The background shows a pink wall and a wooden door, providing the setting for her actions.
