1) The video begins with a woman standing in front of a mirror, wearing a dark blue top. She has long, dark hair and is smiling at the camera.
2) The scene transitions to a close-up of her hair as she starts by parting it, which causes her to then start braiding it.
3) She uses both hands to separate her hair into sections and weave them together, ensuring the braid is tight and neat, and occasionally looks up at the camera, maintaining eye contact.
4) As she continues braiding, she adds more sections of hair, which results in an intricately woven braid.
5) Once the braid is complete, she secures it at the end with a hair tie.
6) After securing the braid, she takes another section of hair from the top of her head and twists it into a bun, securing it with pins.
7) Finally, she adjusts the bun and the braid to ensure they are neat and tidy, and the video ends with the woman looking satisfied with her work.
