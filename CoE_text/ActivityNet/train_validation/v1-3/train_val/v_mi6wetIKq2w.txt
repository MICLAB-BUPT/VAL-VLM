2) This is followed by a close-up of cinnamon roll cookies on a plate, which leads to the ingredients list being shown, indicating what is needed for the recipe.
3) The ingredients are then displayed in bowls, and the mixing process begins, causing the butter to be creamed with sugar using an electric mixer.
4) An egg is added next, leading to the incorporation of flour and baking powder into the mixture, resulting in a smooth dough.
5) The dough is rolled out, and a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar over it causes the creation of the signature flavor of the cookies.
6) A rolling pin is used to flatten the dough further, which is then rolled into a log shape, preparing it for cutting.
