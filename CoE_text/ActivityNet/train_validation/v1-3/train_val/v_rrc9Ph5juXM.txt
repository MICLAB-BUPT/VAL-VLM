1) The video showcases the process of making a moist chocolate cake, which starts with a person cutting butter into a bowl. This is done to prepare the base for the cake mixture.
2) After the butter is in the bowl, the person adds sugar and evaporates milk to create a smooth mixture, causing the ingredients to blend well together.
3) The mixture is heated on a stove until it dissolves, ensuring that the sugar is completely incorporated and the mixture becomes smooth.
4) In another step, the person sifts flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda into another bowl, preparing the dry ingredients for the cake.
5) Eggs are beaten together in a separate container and then added to the butter mixture, followed by the addition of the sifted dry ingredients, causing all the components to combine and form the cake batter.
6) The batter is stirred slowly until smooth, resulting in a consistent texture necessary for the cake's structure.
7) The batter is poured into a greased and lined 7-inch cake tray, setting up the cake for cooking.
8) The tray is placed in a wok with water, and the mixture is steamed for 45 minutes at maximum heat, leading to the cake being cooked through the steam method.
9) After steaming, the cake is removed from the tray and placed on a cooling rack, allowing it to cool down before adding the final touches.
10) Finally, the person prepares a chocolate ganache by melting condensed milk and cocoa powder in a double boiler, creating a topping for the cake.
11) The ganache is poured over the cooled cake, completing the cake with a glossy finish, and making it ready to be served.
