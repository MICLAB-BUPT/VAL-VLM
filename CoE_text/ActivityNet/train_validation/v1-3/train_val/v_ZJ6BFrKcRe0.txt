1) The person decides to fly a kite on a sandy beach, causing them to stand on the sand while holding the kite string.
2) The sky is overcast and the ocean appears calm, which causes the setting to have a serene atmosphere despite the crashing waves in the background.
3) The man's action of flying the kite, which is blue with a long tail (and also has black color as per the second answer), causes it to soar high through the air.
4) The man occasionally adjusts his stance to keep the kite aloft, indicating that he is actively engaged in the activity, which causes him to look up at the kite and smile.
5) The combination of the overcast sky and the calm ocean, along with the crashing waves, creates a scene where it looks like it might rain soon, but this does not deter the man from enjoying his kite-flying experience.
