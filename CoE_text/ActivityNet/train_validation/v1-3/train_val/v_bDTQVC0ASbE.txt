1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'How to Apply Cold Wax' and the name of the presenter, which introduces the topic and the person demonstrating.
2) A man in a red apron is then seen standing in a workshop, holding a green wax block, setting the stage for the demonstration and indicating the materials he will use.
3) He proceeds to demonstrate how to apply cold wax by scraping it onto a metal surface using a metal tool, causing the wax to be placed on the surface in preparation for melting.
4) The man then uses an electric iron (which could also be described as a red iron-like device) to melt the wax, moving it back and forth over the metal surface, which causes the wax to become liquid and spreadable.
5) After melting the wax, he uses a yellow cloth (or sponge) to spread it evenly across the surface, ensuring that the wax covers the area uniformly.
6) Finally, he uses a black brush to smooth out the wax, ensuring an even application, which results in a properly finished and protected surface.
