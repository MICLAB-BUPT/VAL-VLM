1) The video begins with a close-up of a whole pumpkin on a wooden table.
2) A person is shown, who first cuts off the top of the pumpkin, causing an opening to be created.
3) The same person then uses a knife to carve out two triangular eyes and a nose, leading to the formation of a classic jack-o'-lantern face.
4) They proceed to carve out a mouth with sharp, jagged edges, further detailing the face.
5) Pieces of the pumpkin that were carved out are removed and placed beside it, as a result of the carving process.
6) The person places a candle inside the pumpkin, which, when lit, causes the pumpkin to be illuminated from within.
7) This illumination casts a warm glow through the carved features of the pumpkin, creating a festive atmosphere.
8) The video concludes with the text 'Happy Halloween' appearing over the glowing pumpkin, marking the end of the carving demonstration.
