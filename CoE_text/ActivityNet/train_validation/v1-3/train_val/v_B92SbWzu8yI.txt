1) A young boy in an orange shirt and grey pants is playing the conga drums in a room, causing him to be energetically hitting the drums with his hands.
2) The energetic hitting of the drums by the boy creates a rhythmic beat, which causes him to move his body to the music, swaying from side to side and bobbing his head.
3) The enjoyment derived from playing the congas and moving to the beat he created causes the boy to smile and appear to be enjoying himself.
