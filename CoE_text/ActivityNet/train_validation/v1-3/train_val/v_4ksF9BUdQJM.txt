1) A man in a red shirt and blue shorts is mowing the lawn with an electric lawnmower.
2) He starts by pulling out the power cord from a reel, then proceeds to cut the grass in straight lines across the yard, causing him to methodically move across it, ensuring he covers all areas.
3) The lawn is surrounded by a wooden fence, and there are various plants, flowers, and potted plants around the area, with a shed visible in the background.
4) As he mows, he occasionally adjusts his position and direction to reach different sections of the lawn, which allows him to move around the yard, ensuring all areas are covered.
5) The weather appears to be sunny, casting shadows on the ground, and during this process, a white dog enters the scene, walking towards the man as he continues his task.
