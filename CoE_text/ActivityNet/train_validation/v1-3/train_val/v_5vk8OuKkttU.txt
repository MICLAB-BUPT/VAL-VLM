1) The video begins with a man in a black shirt and gray pants standing on a staircase, holding a roll of carpet protector film.
2) He places the film at the top of the stairs and presses it into the base to ensure it sticks, which causes the film to adhere firmly to the starting point.
3) He pulls the carpet protection down the length of two stair treads, making sure not to worry about pressing it into place yet, which ensures that the film is properly aligned.
4) He cuts the film on the first step, providing a base for the process, which allows him to start covering each individual step.
5) Once cut, he presses the film into place on the first stair, smoothing it out as he moves down, which causes the film to be applied evenly and securely.
6) The man repeats this process for the rest of the stairs, ensuring each step is properly covered, which results in all the stairs being protected.
7) The video ends with the man stepping onto the newly protected stairs, showcasing the completed task, which demonstrates the effectiveness of his methodical and precise actions.
