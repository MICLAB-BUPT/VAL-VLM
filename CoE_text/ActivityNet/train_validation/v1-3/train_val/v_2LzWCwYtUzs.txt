1) The video begins with an animated character standing in a kitchen, wearing an apron and holding a pot.
2) This introduction causes the scene to transition to a person washing potatoes under running water in a sink.
3) After washing, the person then proceeds to peel the potatoes on a wooden cutting board using a knife, as a result of needing to remove the skin.
4) Following the peeling, the peeled potatoes are rinsed in a bowl of water, which is done to clean off any remaining dirt or debris.
5) The rinsing leads to the next step where the person cuts the potatoes into smaller pieces on the cutting board, preparing them for cooking.
6) Finally, the sequence of actions ends with the reappearance of the animated character, encouraging viewers to turn off the kitchen and go, as a conclusion to the potato preparation process.
