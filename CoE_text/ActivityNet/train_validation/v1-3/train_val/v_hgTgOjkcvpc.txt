The provided answers describe two different scenarios, one involving cricket and the other croquet. Since they do not align to form a single logical chain of events, it's not possible to integrate them into a coherent sequence without altering the original context or details. Each scenario describes a distinct activity (cricket practice and croquet play) with its own setting and actions. Therefore, no integrated logical chain can be established between the two as per the given instructions.
