1) The video begins with a close-up shot of the ingredients, including Robin Hood all-purpose flour, sugar, butter, and cornstarch, laid out on a marble countertop.
2) This setup causes the person in a yellow apron to start preparing the baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.
3) After preparing the baking sheet, the person uses an electric mixer to cream softened butter until light and fluffy, which then leads to adding sugar to the butter mixture and continuing to beat until combined.
4) The combination of the butter and sugar mixture causes the person to measure and combine flour and cornstarch in a mixing bowl before adding them to the butter mixture.
5) Once the dough is formed, it causes the person to shape it into balls and place these on the prepared baking sheet.
6) Placing the dough balls on the baking sheet then results in flattening them with a fork before they are baked in a preheated oven for 20-25 minutes.
7) Baking the cookies in the oven causes them to be removed once done and allowed to cool on a wire rack.
8) Finally, the cooling of the cookies on the wire rack results in the display of the finished shortbread cookies, which are decorated with chocolate and sprinkles, alongside the Robin Hood flour bag.
