1) The woman starts by applying a heat protectant to her hair, which causes the hair to be shielded from potential damage due to heat exposure.
2) She scrunches excess water out of her hair with a towel, which leads to the removal of extra moisture, preparing the hair for the drying process.
3) The woman then uses a diffuser attachment on her hairdryer, setting it to low heat and sometimes using the cool shot, which results in more controlled and even distribution of heat, preventing frizz and promoting defined curls.
4) She holds her hair in a cup-like motion while drying, ensuring that all curls are dried evenly, which contributes to the overall shape and volume of the curls.
5) The woman also demonstrates a quick scalp massage technique during the drying process, which stimulates blood flow and can enhance the health and appearance of the hair.
6) Throughout the demonstration, she advises on specific techniques such as tilting the hair dryer forward and gathering curls at the top of her head, which causes the curls to have more volume and definition.
7) By keeping the hairdryer on a low setting and ensuring all areas receive equal amounts of heat, she avoids over-drying or damaging her hair, leading to healthier, more voluminous, and well-defined curls.
