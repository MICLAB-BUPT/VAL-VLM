1) The video starts with a man hammering a nail into a wall, likely to secure it for the carpet installation process.
2) This causes the man to unroll and cut a piece of carpet to the required size.
3) After cutting, the man applies adhesive to the carpet's edge, using a bottle with a red cap, which enables him to use a specialized tool to press the carpet down, ensuring it adheres properly.
4) The application of adhesive and pressing the carpet down leads to the man trimming the excess carpet material using a specialized tool, leaving a neat finish around the edges.
5) This causes the man to carefully align and press the carpet against the wall, ensuring a snug fit, and also to trim the carpet around corners and edges, making precise cuts and adjustments.
6) As a result, the man works methodically, using various tools to ensure a professional finish, which ultimately results in a completed carpet installation, showcasing the smooth and even surface.
