1) The video depicts two scuba divers underwater in a pool, practicing various skills, which causes them to be equipped with full scuba gear including tanks, fins, masks, and regulators.
2) The need for clear communication and safety checks while underwater causes the divers to perform synchronized movements, adjust their equipment, check each other's gear, and communicate through hand signals.
3) To ensure they can handle different scenarios, the divers demonstrate buoyancy control, mask clearing techniques, and how to assist each other in case of an emergency, which is facilitated by the clear blue pool environment with visible tiles on the bottom and walls.
4) The active breathing of the divers, indicated by the bubbles rising from them as they exhale, causes the natural lighting, likely from above the water surface, to cast a bright illumination on the scene.
5) At one point, the necessity to practice specific techniques or rest causes one diver to kneel on the pool floor while the other stands beside him, and they continue to interact, adjusting equipment and communicating through hand signals.
6) The requirement to simulate real-world diving situations and maintain stability causes the divers to move around the pool, sometimes holding onto each other for support, all within the clear water that allows good visibility of their movements.
