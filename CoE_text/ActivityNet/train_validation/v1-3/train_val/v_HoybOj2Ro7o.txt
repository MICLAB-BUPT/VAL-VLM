1) The video begins with a black screen displaying white text that reads 'Hello you guys :) Today we will be making an 18 layer cake with zebra fondant decoration <3', which then transitions to a kitchen setting, indicating the start of the cake-making process.
2) In the kitchen, various baking tools and ingredients are shown, including a pot of water, a bowl of frosting, and a plate with layers of cake, preparing the necessary materials for the creation of the 18-layer cake.
3) A person wearing gloves is seen spreading frosting on the cake layers and assembling them into a tall stack, causing the formation of the base structure of the 18-layer cake.
4) The person then applies more frosting to the sides of the cake, smoothing it out evenly, which prepares the surface for the application of fondant and ensures a smooth finish.
5) Next, the person kneads and rolls out fondant, placing it over the top of the cake and trimming the excess, leading to the cake being fully covered with a sheet of white fondant.
6) They use a gold-colored cake board to support the cake and place it onto a decorative plate, enhancing the presentation of the cake.
7) The person cuts out black fondant shapes and attaches them to the side of the cake using a brush dipped in water, creating a zebra pattern, which results in the distinctive design of the cake.
8) Finally, they decorate the cake with red fondant pieces and a red fondant bow, completing the zebra-themed design, thus finishing the decoration of the 18-layer cake.
