1) The video showcases a person, dressed in a black jacket and jeans, applying wallpaper to a wall in a kitchen setting.
2) The individual begins by positioning the wallpaper against the wall, ensuring it is properly aligned, which causes the wallpaper to be straight and correctly positioned at the top of the wall.
3) After aligning, the person carefully peels off the backing film from the wallpaper, starting from the top and moving downwards, which allows the wallpaper to adhere to the wall.
4) They then proceed to smooth out the wallpaper, starting from the top and working their way down, using their hands and a tool to remove any air bubbles or wrinkles, which results in the wallpaper being evenly applied and free of creases or folds.
5) Throughout the process, the person adjusts the wallpaper to fit around a radiator and pipes, making sure it adheres smoothly without creases or gaps, which ensures that the entire wall, including areas with obstacles, is covered neatly.
6) The wallpaper features a black and white filmstrip design with various images, adding a unique visual element to the kitchen environment, which includes a microwave on the counter and a door to the left of the wall being wallpapered.
