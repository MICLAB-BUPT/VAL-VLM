1) The man is in a gym setting, which causes him to be surrounded by various exercise equipment such as treadmills, weight machines, and free weights.
2) Wearing a black t-shirt and black shorts, the man decides to perform a kneeling quad stretch, causing him to position himself with his right knee on a blue mat and his left leg extended behind him.
3) To effectively stretch his quadriceps muscle, the man holds his left foot with both hands and leans forward slightly, which results in him maintaining this position throughout the video to demonstrate proper form for the exercise.
