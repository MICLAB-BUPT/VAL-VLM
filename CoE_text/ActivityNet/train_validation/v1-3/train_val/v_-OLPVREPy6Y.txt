1) A woman is standing in a kitchen, holding a paintbrush and a can of paint, with the intention to paint a cabinet door, which causes her to prepare by having all necessary items on the counter, such as a plastic container filled with water, a can of paint, and a piece of paper.
2) The woman dips the paintbrush into the water, which prepares the brush for absorbing the paint, then she dips it into the black paint, causing the brush to be loaded with paint ready for application.
3) She begins to paint the cabinet door using smooth, even strokes, moving from left to right, which results in an initial layer of paint being applied to the wooden surface.
4) After painting a section, she wipes it down with an orange cloth, which removes excess paint or smudges and helps to ensure that the paint is evenly distributed and there are no imperfections.
5) This process, including dipping the brush into the paint, applying it to the door, and wiping it down with the cloth, is repeated several times, gradually covering the entire surface of the cabinet door and leading to a fully painted and smoothed surface.
