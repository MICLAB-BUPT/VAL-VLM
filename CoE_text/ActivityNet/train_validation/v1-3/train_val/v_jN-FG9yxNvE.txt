1) The video clip opens with a close-up of a person's hands gripping a red pull-up bar, set against the backdrop of an industrial-style gym.
2) As the camera pans out, we see the individual, dressed in a white t-shirt and black pants, performing a series of pull-ups, which causes his muscles to visibly engage as he pulls himself up and lowers down repeatedly.
3) The man starts by hanging from the bar with his arms fully extended, then pulls himself up until his chin is above the bar, which leads to him lowering himself back down to the starting position, and this action is repeated several times throughout the video.
