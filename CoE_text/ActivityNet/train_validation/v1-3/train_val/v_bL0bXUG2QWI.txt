1) In a well-lit gym with various exercise equipment, two individuals are present. One person, wearing a gray hoodie and black pants, is demonstrating a weightlifting exercise while the other, in a gray t-shirt and sweatpants, observes.
2) The demonstrator starts by lifting a dumbbell from the ground to shoulder height, then extends it overhead while kneeling, which causes the observer to watch attentively, occasionally gesturing or moving slightly but remaining focused on the exercise being performed.
3) The demonstration of the exercise, including lunges while maintaining the dumbbell overhead, leads to the observer providing instructions and feedback throughout the routine, indicating that the observer is guiding the demonstrator.
