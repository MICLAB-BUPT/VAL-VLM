2) The man, wearing a striped shirt and apron, peels and cuts the potatoes into chunks, causing the first step of the cooking process to be initiated.
3) He then adds the cut potatoes and salt to a pot of water and cooks them until they are tender, leading to the next phase where he drains the cooked potatoes.
4) After draining, the man mashes the potatoes, adding butter, milk, and cream to the mixture, which results in a smooth and creamy texture.
5) During this process, the woman assists by adding ingredients like salt and pepper, enhancing the flavor of the mashed potatoes.
6) Once the mashed potatoes reach the desired consistency and taste, they are transferred to a serving dish, and the final touch is added through garnishing with a sprig of rosemary, creating an appealing presentation.
7) The setting of a rustic kitchen, along with decorative elements such as flowers, paintings, and lit candles on a wooden table, contributes to a warm and inviting atmosphere, completing the scene.
