2) Ingredients such as eggs, sugar, milk, and vanilla essence are displayed on a black countertop, leading to the preparation stage where a person starts mixing these ingredients.
3) Milk is poured into a bowl containing eggs and sugar, and vanilla essence is added, causing the mixture to be whisked together, integrating the flavors and textures.
4) Flour is sifted into the bowl, and the mixture is whisked again, resulting in a smooth batter, which is necessary for the cake's texture.
5) In another part of the process, a stand mixer blends a white creamy substance, likely whipped cream or frosting, which is then folded into the yellow batter, enhancing the cake's richness and fluffiness.
6) The batter is poured into a greased cake pan, and the use of a spatula to spread it evenly ensures that the cake bakes uniformly, leading to an evenly cooked final product.
7) The cake is baked in an oven, and once cooled, it is sliced and presented on a plate, completing the baking process and showcasing the final result to the viewers.
8) Additionally, oil and vanilla extract are mixed into the batter, and cream cheese and sugar are combined to create a creamy frosting, which is then mixed with the cake batter, contributing to the overall flavor and consistency of the cake.
