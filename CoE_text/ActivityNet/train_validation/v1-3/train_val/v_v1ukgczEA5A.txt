1) The video starts with a black screen displaying the text 'How to... Apply storage wax,' which causes the viewer to understand the instructional nature of the content.
2) It then transitions to a man in a kitchen setting, wearing a black apron and a watch on his left wrist, indicating he is the one who will demonstrate the process, which leads to him working on a wooden workbench with a pair of skis placed on it.
3) The man uses a yellow waxing iron to apply wax to the skis, moving the iron back and forth along the length of the skis, which ensures even application of the wax, causing the base of the skis to be adequately coated.
4) He also uses a white cloth to spread the wax evenly, further ensuring that the wax is distributed uniformly across the ski's surface, which enhances the effectiveness of the waxing process.
5) The background shows a kitchen counter with various items, including a water bottle and some containers, and the lighting is bright, suggesting daytime, providing a clear and well-lit environment for the demonstration.
6) The video ends with a black screen displaying the text 'MBC Technical - winter sports,' which concludes the instructional segment and credits the producer or sponsor, leading to the completion of the instructional video.
