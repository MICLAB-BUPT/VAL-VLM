1) The video starts with a man in a swimming pool, wearing a black swim cap and red swim trunks.
2) He is seen holding a blue and white swim fin in his right hand, which causes him to then put on the swim fins.
3) After putting on the swim fins, he picks up a pair of goggles and puts them on his face, preparing himself for swimming.
4) With the swim fins and goggles now on, he begins to swim freestyle across the pool, using his arms to propel himself forward while keeping his head down.
5) As he swims, the clear and blue water, along with the visible lane dividers in the background, provides a setting that allows for the demonstration of proper technique and form.
6) Throughout the process, the man occasionally adjusts his position and equipment, which leads to him demonstrating various swimming techniques while wearing the swim fins and goggles.
