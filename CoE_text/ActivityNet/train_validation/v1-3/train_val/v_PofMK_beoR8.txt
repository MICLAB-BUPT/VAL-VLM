1) The video begins with a black screen that transitions to an animated logo featuring a yellow figure inside an atom-like structure, surrounded by the text "QUANTENSprung" and "DANCE TO MOON."
2) This introduction leads into a scene set in a gymnasium, where several individuals are seen wearing jumping stilts, indicating the start of their practice session.
3) The participants use the jumping stilts to propel themselves upwards, attempting to jump over a horizontal bar set at different heights, which causes a display of varying levels of skill and coordination among them.
4) As they continue their practice, some individuals successfully clear the bar, including one person who clears a height of 2.62 meters, while others make attempts, leading to a sequence of both successes and efforts captured in the video.
5) The gymnasium, well-lit with natural light entering through large windows, and marked for sports activities with yellow flags placed around the area, provides a suitable environment for these activities, facilitating the participants' engagement and performance.
