1) The video begins with the individual cutting a piece of wallpaper with scissors on a tiled floor, which is the initial step to prepare the wallpaper for application.
2) This action causes the person to then move to the wall where they start applying the cut wallpaper, ensuring it adheres properly and smoothing it out.
3) To ensure the wallpaper fits perfectly, the person measures, cuts, and adjusts the wallpaper according to the wall's dimensions, causing a precise and tailored fit.
4) As part of the application process, the individual uses a tool (and their hands) to press down the wallpaper, which removes any air bubbles and ensures a smooth, seamless finish.
5) Finally, after applying the wallpaper, the man measures and marks the wall with a pencil, possibly to make further adjustments or to mark specific areas for additional work, such as painting.
