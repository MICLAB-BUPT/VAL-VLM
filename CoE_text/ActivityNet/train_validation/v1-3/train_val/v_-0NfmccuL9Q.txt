1) The video depicts a man changing a flat tire on a car, which causes him to start by using a power tool to remove the lug nuts from the flat tire.
2) After removing the lug nuts, he uses a jack to lift the car off the ground, enabling him to then remove the flat tire.
3) Once the flat tire is removed, he replaces it with a spare tire, leading him to tighten the lug nuts on the spare tire using the power tool.
4) Finally, after tightening the lug nuts, he lowers the car back down and checks the new tire for proper inflation, ensuring the completion of the tire change.
