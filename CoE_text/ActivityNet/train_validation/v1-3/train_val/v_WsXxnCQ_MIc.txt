1) The woman starts by applying a product to her hair, which is done to prepare and protect her hair before heat styling.
2) This preparation causes her to then section off her hair, allowing for more manageable and even straightening.
3) She uses the flat iron on each section, which causes the curly hair to become straight due to the heat from the flat iron.
4) In some parts, she also uses a comb in conjunction with the flat iron, which helps to further straighten and smooth her hair.
5) The process of straightening each section with the flat iron and comb, when repeated until all of her hair is straightened, results in her showing off her fully straightened hair at the end of the video.
