1) The video begins with a man in a workshop setting, wearing a blue shirt and brown apron.
2) He is holding a welding rod and explaining the process of measuring the diameter of the rod using a caliper, which causes him to accurately set up the welding parameters.
3) The scene transitions to him showing a red device with a digital display, used for setting the amperage, and this action enables him to adjust the machine's settings appropriately.
4) Next, he demonstrates how to connect the electrode holder to the machine, emphasizing the importance of connecting it to the positive pole, which prepares the equipment for the welding process.
5) He then shows how to connect the electrode holder to an earthing clamp on the work table, ensuring safety and proper electrical grounding.
6) The man proceeds to put on a welding helmet, which leads to him being protected from the bright sparks as he works.
7) After putting on the helmet, he starts welding, creating bright sparks as he works, which results in the joining of the metal pieces.
8) After welding, he inspects his work by removing the welding rod from the metal piece, allowing him to evaluate the quality of the weld.
