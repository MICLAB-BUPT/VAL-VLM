1) The person in a black jacket and pants starts raking leaves in the backyard, gathering them into a pile.
2) After the leaves are piled up, the person picks up the leaves with a rake and places them into a large plastic bag, causing the area to become clearer of loose leaves.
3) Once the bag is filled, the person walks over to a red lawnmower, which they start up, initiating the next phase of yard maintenance.
4) The starting of the lawnmower causes the person to begin mowing the lawn, moving the machine back and forth across the yard, resulting in cut grass.
