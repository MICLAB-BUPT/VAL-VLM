1) The woman starts by spraying her hair with a product, which prepares her hair for the braiding process.
2) She then divides her hair into two even sections, setting up the foundation for the fishtail braid.
3) Taking a small piece from the back of one section and pulling it over to meet the other section causes the start of the fishtail pattern.
4) Repeating this process on the other side ensures that the braid remains balanced and symmetrical.
5) Continuing to braid her hair, crossing sections over each other in a consistent pattern, leads to the formation of the complete fishtail braid.
6) Securing the end of the braid with an elastic band finalizes the structure of the braid.
7) Pulling out a few strands to add a messy edge enhances the style, giving the braid a more relaxed and fashionable look.
