1) The video features a man standing next to a car, demonstrating how to prevent frost from forming on the windshield. He uses a spray bottle and a piece of cardboard to show his method.
2) He sprays the windshield with a liquid, likely antifreeze or de-icer, then places a piece of cardboard over it to protect it from freezing. This action causes the creation of a barrier between the cold air and the glass, which prevents the windshield from freezing.
3) In another part of the video, the man is holding a spray bottle and a cloth. He sprays the windshield with the liquid from the bottle and then wipes it off with the cloth. This action causes the effective cleaning of the windshield.
