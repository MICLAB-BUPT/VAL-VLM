1) The man, wearing a yellow shirt, and the child, wearing an orange life jacket, are in a kayak on a calm river, which causes them to paddle in unison with the man guiding and the child following.
2) As they continue their journey, they pass under a bridge, which adds a sense of adventure, and this experience is part of what makes the atmosphere peaceful.
3) The man, who is also noted to be wearing a yellow life jacket in another observation, is focused on his paddling technique, using a double-bladed paddle to move the narrow, streamlined kayak forward, and this focus on technique and control allows for a smooth and steady progression through the water.
