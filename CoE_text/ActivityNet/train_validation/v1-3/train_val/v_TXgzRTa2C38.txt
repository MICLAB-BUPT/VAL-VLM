1) The video begins with a title screen, which then transitions to a bowling alley where a person, wearing a brown shirt and black pants, is seen preparing to bowl.
2) The person takes a few steps forward, swings his arm back, and releases the dark-colored bowling ball down lane number 3, causing the ball to roll towards the pins and hit them with a loud crash.
3) As a result of the first shot, the man watches as the pins scatter, some falling while others remain standing, leaving one pin still up.
4) This action is repeated on lane number 2 with an orange and white ball, leading to a similar outcome where one pin remains standing.
5) Text appears on the screen, indicating that in 15 years of bowling, he has only made this split once before, suggesting the rarity and difficulty of the task.
6) Finally, the person makes another attempt on lane number 3, releasing another ball, but again, it leaves one pin standing.
