1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the 'RIM RINGZ' logo and the text 'INSTALLATION MANUAL'.
2) It then transitions to a car's wheel on a tiled floor, where a person is seen using a hydraulic jack to lift the car.
3) The person removes the tire and replaces it with a new one, which has a red rim ring installed.
4) The installation of the red rim ring causes the person to inflate the tire of the car using an air pump, ensuring the tire is properly inflated.
5) After inflating, the person checks the tire pressure with a gauge to ensure the correct inflation level, which is a necessary step before reattaching the wheel.
6) The person reattaches the wheel to the car, causing the need to lower the car back down using the hydraulic jack.
7) The video concludes with the 'RIM RINGZ' logo appearing again on a black background.
