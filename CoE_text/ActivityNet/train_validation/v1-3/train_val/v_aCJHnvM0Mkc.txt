2) Initially, the boy is holding a yellow broom and appears to be sweeping the floor, seeming focused and enjoying his task, causing the initial cleaning of the floor by removing loose dirt and debris.
3) After sweeping, the boy transitions to holding a mop and a spray bottle, indicating he is moving on to a deeper clean. This causes him to then spray the floor with the bottle, moistening it for mopping.
4) Subsequently, the boy proceeds to mop the floor using the mop, moving it back and forth across the surface, resulting in a thorough cleaning of the floor.
