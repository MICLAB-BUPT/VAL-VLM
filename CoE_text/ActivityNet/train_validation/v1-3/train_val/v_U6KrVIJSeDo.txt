1) The video starts with a title card reading 'Rowing Machine' on a black background, which transitions to a gym setting where a rowing machine is positioned in the foreground.
2) A person wearing a blue t-shirt with 'GO BLUE' text, black shorts, and white sneakers enters the frame and sits on the rowing machine, causing the focus to shift to him.
3) He places his feet into the footrests and grabs the handle with both hands, initiating the demonstration of the rowing machine's use.
4) The man's legs are bent at the knees, and he pulls the handle towards his chest while leaning back slightly, performing a rowing motion.
5) His arms extend forward as he pushes the handle away from his body, returning to the starting position, which causes the cycle to repeat rhythmically throughout the video.
