1) A person wearing a red cap, white long-sleeve shirt, and dark pants (later described as a gray jacket and black pants) is using a leaf blower to clear fallen leaves from a yard, which causes the leaves to be gathered.
2) The presence of a wooden fence, trees with autumn foliage, and a house in the background sets the scene where the action takes place.
3) The person moves around the yard, directing the leaf blower at different areas, which results in the leaves being blown into a pile near the fence.
4) The man works systematically, ensuring all leaves are collected efficiently, which leads to the effective clearing of the yard.
