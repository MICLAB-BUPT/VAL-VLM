1) The video opens with a man and woman sitting on a couch, the man in a gray t-shirt and the woman in a gray v-neck top, which causes them to discuss their experiences with rollerblading and biking.
2) This discussion about their activities then leads to the scene shifting to an outdoor skate park where the man is seen rollerblading, followed by shots of him riding a bicycle through a park.
3) The enjoyment and participation in these outdoor activities cause the couple to be shown again on the couch, continuing their conversation about their activities, which in turn results in the video cutting back to the man rollerblading, this time in a different park setting, and then back to the couple on the couch.
4) Finally, the continuation of their active and engaging day leads to the last shot showing the man riding his bike through another park area, with the implication that the woman might also be participating alongside him.
