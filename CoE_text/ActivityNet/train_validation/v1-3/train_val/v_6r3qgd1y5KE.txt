1) The woman in a black shirt and pants starts by cleaning the wall with a cloth, which causes the surface to be free of dust and debris, ensuring better adhesion for the wallpaper.
2) She then measures and marks the wall using a yellow measuring tape, which allows her to determine the appropriate placement for the vinyl, leading to a well-organized and symmetrical installation.
3) Next, she unrolls a large piece of white wallpaper and carefully aligns it against the wall, smoothing it out as she goes, which results in an even application without wrinkles or air bubbles.
4) The process involves precise adjustments and careful alignment, causing the wallpaper to be applied evenly and smoothly across the wall.
5) To reach higher sections, she uses a step ladder, which enables her to continue smoothing out the vinyl all the way up, ensuring that the entire wall is covered properly.
6) Finally, after completing the application, she steps back to inspect her work, which leads to a thorough check for any imperfections, ensuring the vinyl is perfectly aligned and adhered to the wall.
