1) The man, dressed in a black shirt and shorts, begins by measuring and marking the wall with a tape measure, which causes him to have a guideline for where to apply the plaster.
2) After preparing the wall, he pours plaster into a bucket and mixes it with a drill mixer, causing the plaster to reach the right consistency for application.
3) He then uses a trowel to spread the plaster evenly on the wall, ensuring a smooth finish, which is caused by his careful and precise movements with the trowel.
4) To ensure the wall is straight, he uses a long tool to measure and level the wall, causing any uneven areas to be identified and corrected.
5) He applies more plaster to the wall, spreading it smoothly with the trowel again, which further ensures the wall's surface is even and well-covered.
6) Finally, he uses a hose to spray water on the wall, likely to clean off excess plaster or prepare the surface for painting, causing the wall to be ready for the next step in the renovation process.
