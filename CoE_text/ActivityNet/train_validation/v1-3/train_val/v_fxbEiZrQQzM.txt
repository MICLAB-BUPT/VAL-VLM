1) The tall and lush grass in the vast, green field, which has not been maintained regularly, causes the group of people, including children and adults, to engage in the task of cutting it.
2) The need for sun protection in the overcast sky, likely during early morning or late afternoon, causes some individuals to wear hats while they work.
