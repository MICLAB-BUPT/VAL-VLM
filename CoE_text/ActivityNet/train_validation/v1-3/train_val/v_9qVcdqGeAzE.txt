1) A woman with long brown hair is demonstrating how to dry and style wet hair using a round brush and a blow dryer.
2) She starts by brushing her hair, which causes the tangles to be removed and prepares her hair for drying.
3) Then, she uses the blow dryer to dry it while simultaneously brushing it upwards, causing the hair to start drying and taking on a styled shape.
4) She continues to brush and dry her hair, ensuring it's evenly styled, which results in a consistent and neat appearance.
5) The use of the round brush while drying causes the hair to become smooth and adds volume or curl as desired.
6) After a few moments, she stops using the hair dryer and brushes, and lets her hair fall naturally, leading to the final look of the hairstyle.
