1) The video shows a person decorating a spherical cake using chocolate frosting.
2) Initially, the cake is covered in a layer of chocolate frosting with some areas unevenly coated, which causes the decorator to use various tools and techniques to improve its appearance.
3) The person then uses a piece of cardboard to create an arch shape over the cake's top edge, pressing it down to smooth out the frosting, thereby ensuring that the top part of the cake has a more uniform coating.
4) Next, they apply more chocolate frosting around the base of the cake, ensuring it is evenly spread, which contributes to the overall polished look of the cake.
5) They also use a spatula to smooth out the frosting on the sides and top of the cake, giving it a polished look, while the hands are seen applying the dark brown substance (chocolate frosting) onto the sphere using a brush and a piece of plastic wrap.
6) The process involves spreading the substance evenly across the surface of the sphere, ensuring it is fully coated, which results in a beautifully decorated spherical cake.
