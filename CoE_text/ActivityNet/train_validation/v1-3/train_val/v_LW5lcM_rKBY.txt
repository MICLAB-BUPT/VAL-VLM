1) In a well-lit kitchen, an individual is using a power drill with a peeler attachment to peel potatoes, causing the skin to be removed efficiently.
2) The person holds the potato in one hand and the drill in the other, rotating the potato against the spinning blade of the peeler, which leads to the accumulation of potato skins on the counter beside them.
3) The peeled potato skins fall onto a white cloth spread on the table, indicating that the surface is being used to collect the waste.
4) The environment looks clean and organized, with neutral tones dominating the space, suggesting that the setting is prepared for food preparation, which causes a sense of order and readiness.
5) Another person's hands are visible, holding another potato ready for peeling, implying that there is collaboration or assistance in the task, which results in a more efficient process.
