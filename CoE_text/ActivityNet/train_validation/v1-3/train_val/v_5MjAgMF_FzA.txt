2) This introduction causes the transition to a kitchen setting where a person, dressed in a white chef's coat and gloves, is seen holding chopsticks and a frying pan over a stove with a blue flame, preparing to demonstrate the omelette-making process.
3) The person then pours beaten eggs from a pot into the frying pan, using the chopsticks to help guide the eggs, which initiates the cooking process.
4) As the eggs start to cook, the person continues to use the chopsticks to move them around the pan, ensuring even cooking, which is crucial for achieving the perfect texture of the omelette.
5) Once the eggs are cooked, the person shapes them into an omelette form and carefully rolls it up using the chopsticks, showcasing their skillful handling of the tools and ingredients.
6) The demonstration of the omelette-making process concludes, leading to the appearance of a black screen displaying the text 'Ganbatte !!' in blue letters, which serves as an encouragement or closing remark, translating to 'Do your best!!' in English.
