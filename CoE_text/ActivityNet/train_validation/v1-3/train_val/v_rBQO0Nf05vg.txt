1) The video begins with a title screen that reads 'Basic Steps on Installing Carpet', setting the stage for the instructional content.
2) A man, dressed in a black shirt and blue jeans, is then shown rolling out a red carpet in a room, initiating the carpet installation process.
3) He uses a vacuum cleaner to clean the floor before laying down a new carpet, causing the surface to be free of dirt and debris, which is essential for proper installation.
4) The man then unrolls a gray carpet over the cleaned floor, indicating a change or an additional layer of carpet being installed.
5) Using a tool, he cuts the carpet, ensuring it fits properly around the edges of the room, allowing the carpet to align neatly with the room's dimensions.
6) He uses a hammer and other tools to secure the carpet in place, making sure it is tightly fitted against the walls, resulting in a stable and well-installed carpet.
7) Finally, he vacuums the newly installed carpet to remove any loose fibers or debris, leading to a clean and finished appearance of the newly installed carpet.
