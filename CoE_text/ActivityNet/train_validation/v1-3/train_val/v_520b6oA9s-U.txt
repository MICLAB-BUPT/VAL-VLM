1) The woman in the kitchen, wearing a black top with colorful dots and a headband, begins by explaining the process of making a Semolina Orange Cake with Syrup.
2) She starts the preparation by cracking eggs into a bowl, adding sugar, and mixing them together, which causes the initial ingredients to blend.
3) Adding orange zest, vanilla essence, and spices to the mixture enhances the flavor, leading to a more aromatic and tasty batter.
4) Sifting flour into a separate bowl and then combining it with the wet ingredients, including oil and milk, results in a smooth batter, ready for baking.
5) Pouring the batter into a greased baking pan lined with parchment paper prepares the cake for even baking, causing the formation of a well-structured cake.
6) Baking the cake in the oven until it is done, followed by allowing it to cool, ensures that the cake is properly set and can absorb the syrup without falling apart.
7) Preparing the syrup by boiling water, sugar, and orange juice (or just sugar and orange juice) in a saucepan creates a sweet, citrusy liquid, designed to be absorbed by the cake, thereby making it moist and flavorful.
8) Pouring the prepared syrup over the cake while it's still warm causes the cake to absorb the syrup, resulting in a moist and delicious dessert.
9) Finally, cutting a slice of the cake and serving it on a plate showcases the finished product, ready to be enjoyed.
