1) The person in the video is preparing to cook an omelet, which causes them to start by cracking eggs into a bowl and whisking them together.
2) After the eggs are properly whisked, they pour oil into a frying pan and heat it up on the stove, causing the pan to become sufficiently hot for cooking.
3) Once the pan is hot, they pour the whisked eggs into the pan, which leads to the use of a spatula to move the eggs around, ensuring even cooking.
4) The continuous movement and cooking of the eggs cause the eggs to eventually be fully cooked through.
5) Finally, the full cooking of the eggs prompts the person to transfer the cooked eggs onto a plate and serve them.
