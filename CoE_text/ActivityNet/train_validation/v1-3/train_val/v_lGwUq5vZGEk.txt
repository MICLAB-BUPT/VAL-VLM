1) The video shows a young woman with long brown hair standing in front of a striped shower curtain, wearing a white tank top and a necklace.
2) She begins by brushing her hair, which causes the hair to become smooth and tangle-free.
3) After brushing, she starts braiding her hair, using her hands to separate the hair into sections and weave them together, causing the formation of a braid.
4) As she braids, she occasionally looks at the camera and makes hand gestures, indicating engagement with the viewer.
5) She continues braiding until it reaches the end, then ties it off with a hair tie, securing the braid.
6) She takes another section of hair from the side of her head and repeats the braiding process, leading to the creation of a second braid.
7) Finally, she ties off the end of this braid as well, completing the hairstyle.
8) Throughout the process, she appears focused on her task, demonstrating a methodical approach to creating the braids.
9) At the end, she turns around to show the back of her braid, allowing the viewer to see the finished result.
