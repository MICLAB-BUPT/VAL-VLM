1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the tutorial on how to apply contact lenses, which causes it to transition to a scene featuring two women: one in a black top and glasses (the learner), and another in a dark outfit, presumably an optician or consultant.
2) The optician starts by washing her hands under a tap, causing her to handle the contact lens case safely and take out a lens. She explains the steps while the other woman watches attentively, leading to a clear demonstration of the process.
3) The optician shows the lens to the camera, emphasizing its shape and size, which then causes her to demonstrate the correct technique for applying the lens to her own eye.
4) Following the optician's demonstration, the woman in the black top attempts to apply the lens herself, with the optician providing guidance and support, ensuring she follows the proper technique.
5) The optician cleans her hands again, likely preparing for the next step or to ensure hygiene, which then leads to the conclusion of the instructional segment.
