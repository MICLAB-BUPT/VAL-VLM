1) The video begins with a man in a bathroom, wearing a blue shirt and glasses.
2) He is holding a tile and applying adhesive to it using a trowel, which causes the tile to be ready for placement on the wall.
3) The man then places the tile on the wall, aligning it carefully, ensuring that the tiles are properly positioned.
4) Next, he uses a sponge to clean the grout lines between the tiles, leading to a cleaner and more professional appearance of the tiled surface.
5) The man continues to work on the bathroom, applying more adhesive to the tiles and placing them on the wall, which results in the expansion of the tiled area.
6) He then uses a tool to cut the tiles to size, allowing for the tiles to fit precisely in the designated spaces.
7) The man moves outside to a brick wall where he uses a grinder to smooth out the edges of the tiles, causing the edges to become smoother and more suitable for installation.
8) Finally, he returns to the bathroom and cleans the tiles with a cloth, resulting in a finished and polished look.
