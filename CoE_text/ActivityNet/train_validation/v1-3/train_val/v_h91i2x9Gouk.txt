5) The video also includes the woman holding up two different colored mops, one white and one yellow, before she proceeds to demonstrate the use of the mop with the bucket, causing her to pour liquid from the bottle into the bucket, place the mop inside, and wring it out using the bucket's built-in wringer.
6) The demonstration of the mop's effectiveness in cleaning the surface leads the video to conclude with a blue screen displaying text about the product's features and benefits.
