1) The man in a white sweater and black shirt, standing in front of a mirror and holding a hairbrush and a bottle of shampoo, begins preparing for a hair styling session, which causes him to start the process by brushing the woman's blonde hair with darker roots.
2) After brushing her hair, he sprays it with a product, causing the hair to be prepped for styling.
3) The man then proceeds to blow dry and style the woman's hair using a round brush and a hairdryer, focusing on the top section, which leads to the application of different techniques such as sectioning, brushing, and using heat tools.
4) Throughout this process, the woman sits patiently, occasionally looking at the man, while he remains focused on ensuring that her hair looks perfect, thereby creating a professional and attentive atmosphere in the salon setting.
