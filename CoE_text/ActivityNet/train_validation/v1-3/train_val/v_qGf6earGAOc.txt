1) The video opens with a man driving a vehicle through a rural landscape, which causes the scene to be set for the 'Red Bull Winch Session' Episode 3.
2) This is followed by a sunset over a body of water and a close-up of red berries on the ground, leading to the introduction of Josh Tranby who is seen carrying a wakeboard and a can.
3) Josh Tranby then starts wakeboarding across the berry field, which results in the creation of splashes as he moves, indicating that the red liquid surface mentioned is actually the field covered with red berries.
4) During his wakeboarding, he holds onto a rope attached to a vehicle, which pulls him across the berry field, enabling him to perform various maneuvers and create splashes and waves in the red berries.
5) The video concludes with a wide shot of the now disturbed berry field and a black van driving away, signifying the end of the event.
