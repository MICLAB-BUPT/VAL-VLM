1) The video starts with a title screen for 'This Old House' and the topic 'How to Strip Wallpaper with Painter Jim Clark.'
2) This introduction causes the scene to shift to a man in a blue shirt holding a blue container, explaining its use.
3) His explanation leads to the demonstration of using a sponge on wallpaper-covered walls, where he is assisted by another person in a blue shirt.
4) The need for soaking the wallpaper causes the man to soak white cloths in a blue bucket filled with soapy water.
5) After soaking, the man applies the wet cloth to the wallpaper, which prepares it for removal.
6) To further loosen the wallpaper, the man sprays a liquid onto it, causing it to become easier to peel off.
7) The spraying and soaking cause the wallpaper to be more easily removed, allowing the man and his assistant to work together to strip it from the wall.
8) During the process, the man wears gloves while the woman does not, and they both use tools, such as a scraper, to aid in removing the wallpaper.
9) Once the wallpaper is removed, the man inspects the wall, pointing out areas where the wallpaper has been successfully taken off.
10) The completion of the wallpaper removal task causes the video to end with a title screen displaying 'This Old House' and their website URL.
