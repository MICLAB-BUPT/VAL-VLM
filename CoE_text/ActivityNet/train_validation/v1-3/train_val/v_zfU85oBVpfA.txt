3) The individual maintains the stretch position throughout the clip, demonstrating the exercise technique, which allows the viewer to learn how to properly perform the hip flexor stretch from a half-kneeling position using a dowel.
4) In another part of the video, it shows a person performing a hip flexor stretch exercise using a foam roller instead of a dowel, causing a variation in the method of stretching to be presented.
5) The individual is kneeling on one knee with the other leg bent at a 90-degree angle, resting their foot on the foam roller placed under their thigh, and holding onto a vertical pole for support, which enables them to maintain balance and control during the stretch.
