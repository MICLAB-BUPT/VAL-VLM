1) The video starts with a title card reading 'Maddy's Cooking Show' against a pink background, which causes the introduction of the young girl in a pink apron standing in a kitchen.
2) The presence of baking ingredients and utensils around her leads to her beginning the recipe by pouring milk into a large pink bowl.
3) Adding other ingredients like flour and peanut butter after the milk results in her mixing the ingredients thoroughly.
4) Incorporating oats into the mixture causes her to form small mounds on a pink plate.
5) An older man joining her and tasting the mixture together with her leads to the girl continuing to explain the process while gesturing towards the camera.
6) Her explanation and interaction with the camera, along with the man's participation, contribute to the conclusion of the video, ending with a black screen displaying 'Check out the next episode of Maddy's Cooking Show!'.
