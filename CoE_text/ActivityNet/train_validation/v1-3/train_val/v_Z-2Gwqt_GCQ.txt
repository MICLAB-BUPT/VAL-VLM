1) The video begins with a white screen that transitions to a wooden floor where cleaning supplies are laid out, causing the viewer to focus on the setting and tools for the upcoming cleaning process.
2) A person in white clothing is seen mopping the floor, which causes the initial dirt and dust to be removed from the surface.
3) Following the dry mopping, the person pours liquid into a bucket and wrings out a cloth, preparing for a more thorough cleaning of the floor.
4) This preparation causes the person to then use a mop to clean the floor thoroughly, ensuring all areas are reached and cleaned effectively.
5) After the wet cleaning, the person applies a liquid wax cleaner to the floor using a cloth, which causes the floor to have an even layer of protection and shine.
6) The application of the wax cleaner leads to the final step, where the video shows a polished wooden floor with a glass coffee table on it, indicating the completion of the cleaning process.
