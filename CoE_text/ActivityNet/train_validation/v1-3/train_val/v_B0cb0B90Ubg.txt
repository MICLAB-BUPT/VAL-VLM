1) The man, wearing sunglasses and a dark-colored t-shirt, is in the backyard with a large, fluffy white dog, indicating he is preparing to groom the dog.
2) The calm and cooperative demeanor of the dog causes the man to start brushing its fur with a yellow brush, which is the first step in the grooming process.
3) After brushing, the man uses a yellow comb to further groom the dog's fur, caused by the need for a more detailed grooming after the initial brushing.
4) To make the fur easier to manage or style, the man wets the dog's fur using a yellow spray bottle, which is a common practice in grooming to help detangle and smooth the fur.
5) Finally, the man blow-dries the dog's fur, an action caused by the necessity to dry the wet fur, completing the grooming session.
