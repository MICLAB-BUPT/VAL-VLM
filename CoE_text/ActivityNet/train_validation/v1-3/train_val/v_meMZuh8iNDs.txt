1) The video starts with a woman in a well-lit room, wearing a grey t-shirt and green overalls, seated at a vanity table filled with various makeup items, and speaking directly to the camera, using hand gestures for emphasis. 
2) This initial scene causes the transition to a title card reading 'Tessa D'Arcia' against a pastel gradient background.
3) After the title card, she then lies on a bed with patterned bedding, brushing her hair and styling it into a braid, which leads to her continuing to speak while demonstrating the braiding process.
4) Upon completing the braid, she sits up, causing the scene to return to her at the vanity table where she continues her conversation and gesturing towards the camera.
