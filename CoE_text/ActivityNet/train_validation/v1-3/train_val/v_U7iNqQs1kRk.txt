1) In the video, two men are seen in a room with wooden flooring and warm lighting, creating a cozy ambiance.
2) The man on the left is seated behind a set of conga drums, actively playing them with his hands, which causes the creation of a rhythmic beat.
3) The man on the right, who is also seated, faces the drummer and appears to be listening or possibly giving instructions, causing the drummer to follow a specific rhythm.
4) The man on the right then stands up behind the seated drummer, leading the rhythm, which causes the seated man to follow along.
