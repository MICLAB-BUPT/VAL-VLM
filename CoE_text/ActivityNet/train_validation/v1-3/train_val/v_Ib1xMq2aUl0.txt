1) The video begins with a panoramic view of a cityscape, which then transitions to a black screen with the text "ZURICH BLADE", setting the stage and indicating the theme of the video.
2) This introduction causes the scene to shift to an urban setting where three men are rollerblading on a street marked with red lines, aligning with the theme introduced.
3) The presence of parked cars, pedestrians, and a large building with classical architecture in the background provides a vibrant and dynamic environment, which allows the rollerbladers to perform various maneuvers and tricks while skating around each other.
4) The rollerbladers, dressed casually and some with protective gear, move energetically and showcase their skills, which is a direct result of the engaging and lively urban environment that supports and enhances their activity.
