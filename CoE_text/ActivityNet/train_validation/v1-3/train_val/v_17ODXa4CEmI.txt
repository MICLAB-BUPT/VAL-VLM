1) The video begins with a close-up of two glasses filled with lemonade, each garnished with a lemon slice.
2) The camera then pans to show the preparation process, starting with a person pouring water from a glass pitcher into a stainless steel pot, which causes the water to be ready for the next step.
3) Sugar is added to the pot and stirred until dissolved, causing the sugar to be evenly distributed in the water.
4) The scene transitions to lemons being sliced on a wooden cutting board, followed by juicing the lemons using a manual juicer, resulting in freshly squeezed lemon juice.
5) The freshly squeezed lemon juice is then poured into a large glass pitcher, combining it with the sugar-water solution that has been prepared, causing the basic ingredients of the lemonade to be mixed together.
6) Ice cubes are added to the pitcher, and the lemonade is stirred, leading to a chilled and well-mixed beverage.
7) Finally, the lemonade is poured into the glasses, completing the refreshing beverage, which results in the final product being ready for consumption.
