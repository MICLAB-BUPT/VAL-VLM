1) The video begins with a close-up of a person's hands holding a small black bag labeled 'Green Ice Ski Wax' containing a white cloth and a brown block, which indicates the preparation for ski maintenance.
2) The person then takes out the white bottle labeled 'GIFE 100% Bio biodegradable' and applies it to a ski placed on a red stand, causing the ski to be coated with the wax for improved performance.
3) They rub the wax onto the ski, ensuring even coverage, which is done to distribute the wax uniformly across the ski's surface.
4) Next, they use a cork block to further polish the ski's surface, which helps in embedding the wax into the ski's base, enhancing its smoothness and durability.
5) Finally, they buff the ski with a white cloth to achieve a smooth finish, resulting in a well-maintained ski ready for use.
