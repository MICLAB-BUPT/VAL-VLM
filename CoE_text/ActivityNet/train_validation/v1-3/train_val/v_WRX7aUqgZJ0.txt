1) The person holds a white and pink electric iron with a cord.
2) The person uses the iron to press down on a long, transparent plastic sheet (not glass panel, as it is more likely to be malleable under heat), which is placed on a metal stand.
3) The person carefully moves the iron back and forth over the plastic, causing it to soften due to the heat applied by the iron.
4) As a result of the heat, the softened plastic begins to conform to the shape of the metal stand.
