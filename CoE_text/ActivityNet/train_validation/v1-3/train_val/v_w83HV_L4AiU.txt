1) The video starts with a title screen featuring a cartoon moose and the text 'MAPLE LEAF LEARNING', which causes it to transition to a blue background with the words 'ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS' in bold letters.
2) A hand demonstrates each gesture: rock (fist), paper (two fingers), and scissors (three fingers), causing the scene to shift to a green starburst with the word 'Hey!' in yellow.
3) A question mark appears on a pink starburst, followed by a white background with a red crab and a green snail making the peace sign, leading to a purple bird flying between two hands forming a heart shape.
4) The video then shows a yellow starburst with 'Hey!' and a question mark on a pink starburst, which results in a woman's hand making a fist, followed by a countdown from 3 to 1 in a yellow starburst.
5) The person's hand movements are synchronized with the voice-over instructions, which guide viewers through the steps of playing the game, causing the video to end with a black screen.
