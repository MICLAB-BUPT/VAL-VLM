1) The video begins with a close-up of a light green surgical glove on a brown marble floor, with a pair of scissors nearby, which causes the scene to transition to a person's hands holding the glove and scissors.
2) The person cuts the glove into smaller pieces, causing them to fold the cut pieces and use tweezers for manipulation, in order to create a makeshift bandage.
3) The person places the folded glove on a red cushion next to a white dog's paw, leading them to use pliers to attach a small metal object (a pin) to the glove piece, securing it.
4) Finally, the person holds the glove piece with the attached metal object near the dog's paw, preparing for an operation, which is essentially applying the makeshift bandage to the dog's paw.
