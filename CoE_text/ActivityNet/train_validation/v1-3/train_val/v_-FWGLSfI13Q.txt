1) The family decides to carve a pumpkin together, causing the young boy and his father to engage in the activity.
2) The young boy, dressed in pajamas, begins scooping out the insides of the pumpkin with an orange scoop, which causes his father to assist him in the process.
3) The father then draws a face on the pumpkin using a black marker, leading to the next step where he helps the boy carve out the eyes and mouth.
4) The boy uses a small knife to cut out the shapes, guided by his father, resulting in the carved pieces being removed from the pumpkin.
5) The boy then continues to scoop out the remaining seeds and pulp from inside the pumpkin, which is facilitated by the father's support.
6) Throughout the carving process, the man (father) holds the pumpkin steady, enabling the boy to more easily scoop out the seeds and pulp with the orange plastic spoon.
7) After completing the carving and cleaning, the family admires their finished pumpkin, now glowing, as a result of their collaborative effort.
