1) The person wearing a red shirt decides to play the conga drums, which causes them to sit in front of the two conga drums.
2) The conga drums, with their natural wood finish and metal hardware (or yellow with black rims and silver hardware), are positioned side by side, which allows the player to reach and strike both drumheads easily.
3) As the person's hands move rhythmically across the drumheads, this action creates a percussive beat, indicating that the individual is skilled in playing the conga drums.
4) The presence of other percussion instruments such as snare drums and cymbals in the background suggests that the space is designated for musical practice or performance, which explains why the person is playing the conga drums there.
