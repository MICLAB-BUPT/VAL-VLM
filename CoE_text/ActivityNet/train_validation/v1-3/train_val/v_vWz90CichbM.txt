1) The video begins with a title card displaying 'Alltype Roofing Co. est 1972' against a white background, which causes the introduction of the company and sets the context for the upcoming content.
2) It transitions to a man working on a roof, where he starts by removing old tiles, which is necessary to prepare the surface for new ones.
3) After clearing the old tiles, the man mixes mortar in a container, causing the preparation of the adhesive that will hold the new tiles in place.
4) The prepared mortar is then applied onto the roof structure, enabling the secure placement of the new red tiles over the prepared area.
5) As the man places the new tiles, he ensures they are properly aligned and secured, which involves using a trowel to smooth out the mortar around the tiles, enhancing their stability and appearance.
6) Finally, the scene shows the completed section of the roof with neatly placed tiles and visible metal brackets (or nails as mentioned in the second answer) securing them, resulting in a well-finished and durable roofing job.
