1) The woman, dressed in a black shirt and jeans with long blonde hair, begins by introducing the features of a brown wooden dresser with a pinkish interior, which causes her to start the painting process.
2) She initiates the transformation by applying white paint from a can labeled 'Coral' to the dresser, including its curved top, three drawers, and legs, causing the dresser's appearance to change from brown to white.
3) After covering the main body of the dresser in white, she decides to add a contrasting color, which leads to her painting the lower drawers yellow (not orange as mistakenly mentioned), creating a two-tone effect on the dresser.
4) Her careful application of paint to each section, ensuring an even coat, results in the final presentation of the fully painted dresser, now featuring both white and yellow colors, showcasing the complete transformation.
