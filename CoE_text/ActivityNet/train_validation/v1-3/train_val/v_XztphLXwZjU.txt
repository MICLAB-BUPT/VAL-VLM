1) The video shows a person laying tiles on a floor in an indoor space, which is illuminated by natural light coming through windows.
2) Initially, the floor is partially covered with wooden planks, and the person begins by using a trowel to spread adhesive from a yellow bucket onto the concrete surface, causing the preparation for tile placement.
3) The person then places beige tiles onto the adhesive, ensuring they are level and aligned, which causes the formation of a new, tiled surface.
4) Throughout the process, the person uses tools such as a spirit level, measuring tape, and a hammer to adjust the tiles, remove excess adhesive, and clean up the area around the work zone, which ensures the quality and neatness of the tiling.
5) The man continues this process, spreading adhesive, placing and aligning each tile, and checking their straightness and evenness, which results in the entire floor being covered with tiles.
6) The final frames show the nearly completed tile floor with only a few tiles left to be laid, indicating the near completion of the tiling project.
