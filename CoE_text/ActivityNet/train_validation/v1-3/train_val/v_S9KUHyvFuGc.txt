1) The video begins with a man on horseback in an outdoor arena, preparing to rope a calf. He is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt, jeans, and a cowboy hat, and the horse is white. The arena has a dirt floor and metal fencing, with trees in the background.
2) The man rides his horse towards a gate where another man is standing, causing the gate to be opened and the calf to be released.
3) As he approaches the gate, he throws his lasso into the air, aiming for the calf that has just been released from the gate, which causes the calf to run across the arena.
4) The man successfully ropes the calf, which leads him to dismount his horse and tie the calf's legs together.
5) Another man on horseback, who was watching from the side of the arena, approaches to assist him, but the original man completes the task alone.
6) After tying the calf, the man walks back to his horse, mounts it, and rides away, concluding the event.
