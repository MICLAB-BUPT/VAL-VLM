1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'Premium Woodcare' and 'How-To Video Series' on a yellow banner, followed by the Cabot logo, which causes it to transition to an outdoor setting where wooden planks are laid out on a grassy field.
2) In this outdoor setting, a man in white pants, a gray shirt, and a white cap is seen applying a reddish-brown stain to the wooden planks using a brush, which leads him to dip the brush into a container of stain and then apply it evenly across the surface of the planks.
3) The act of applying the stain is emphasized with text overlays providing tips such as 'Cover the area below your deck to protect concrete and patio,' 'STAIN BRUSHES,' 'CABOT PAD APPLICATOR,' 'TRIM TOOLS,' 'STIR OFTEN,' 'THE RIGHT AMOUNT,' 'AVOID LAP MARKS,' 'EVEN COATS,' and 'WAIT 24 TO 48 HOURS,' causing the man to ensure thorough coverage and even application.
4) As a result of following these instructions and the man's careful application, the video concludes with a close-up of the finished stained wood, showcasing the rich color and even application.
