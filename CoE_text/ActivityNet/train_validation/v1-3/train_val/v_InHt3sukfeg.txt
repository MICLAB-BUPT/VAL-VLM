1) The video begins with a close-up of a white metal table and chairs set in a garden, setting the scene for a refurbishing project.
2) A person, specifically a woman, is shown sanding down the table's surface, which causes the removal of old paint and rust, preparing the furniture for a new coat of paint.
3) After sanding, she cleans the table with a brush and a cloth, causing the removal of dust and debris, ensuring the surface is clean and ready for painting.
4) She then uses a spray can to apply a rust-proof paint to the table, focusing on even coverage, which leads to a protective layer that prevents future rust and enhances the appearance of the furniture. This step is repeated for the chairs as well.
5) During the painting process, she wears gloves and a mask for protection, which causes a reduction in her exposure to potentially harmful substances from the paint.
6) The application of Hammerite products, which are highlighted for their features like 'Up to 8 years weather protection' and 'Corrosion resistant', results in an effective and durable finish on the furniture.
7) The final scene shows the fully painted table and chairs set in the garden, looking pristine and well-maintained, caused by the thorough preparation and careful application of the rust-proof paint.
