1) A woman with blonde hair, wearing a light green jacket over a white shirt, stands in a kitchen. She gestures with her hands while speaking, then turns on the faucet and lets the water run for a few seconds, which is to prepare for cleaning the sink.
2) The running water causes her to use a white cloth to wipe down the inside of the sink, paying attention to the corners and edges, as part of demonstrating how to clean a kitchen sink.
3) After cleaning the sink, she turns off the faucet, which leads to her drying her hands with the same cloth.
