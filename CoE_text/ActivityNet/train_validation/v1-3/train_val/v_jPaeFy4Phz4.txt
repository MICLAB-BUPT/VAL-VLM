1) The woman begins by gathering her hair into a high ponytail, which is the initial step to create an elegant updo hairstyle.
2) She then twists the ponytail into a bun and secures it with bobby pins, causing the hair to form the basic shape of the updo.
3) The use of a hair donut accessory follows, creating a smooth, voluminous look at the base of the bun, enhancing the overall appearance and fullness of the hairstyle.
4) To add texture and detail, she braids a section of hair and incorporates it into the bun, resulting in a more intricate and visually appealing design.
5) Finally, she adjusts the bun and adds a finishing touch with the hair donut accessory, ensuring the hairstyle is neat and secure.
