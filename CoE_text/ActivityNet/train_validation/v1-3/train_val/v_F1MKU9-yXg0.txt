2) A man in a green hoodie and black pants stands next to a wheelbarrow filled with soil, indicating that he is about to start a landscaping task.
3) He pushes the wheelbarrow across a yard towards a house, causing the soil to be transported to the desired location.
4) The man tilts the wheelbarrow to empty the soil onto a pile, resulting in the soil being placed where it is needed.
5) He then uses a rake (or shovel as mentioned in the second answer) to spread the soil evenly along the base of the house, leading to an even distribution of the soil.
6) The scene transitions to a 'before mulch' view of a garden bed with dry grass and bare soil, showing the state of the area before any work has been done.
7) This is followed by an 'after mulch' view, which displays the same area covered with dark brown mulch, neatly spread around a curved stone border, indicating the completion of the landscaping task.
8) The video concludes with another title screen displaying 'TASKS UNLIMITED, INC. Landscape Maintenance' and the 20th Anniversary logo, reinforcing the brand and the celebratory nature of the event.
