1) The video begins with a woman standing in front of a black car, explaining the process of changing a spare wheel.
2) She opens the trunk, which causes her to retrieve the necessary tools: a wrench, a jack, a locking wheel bolt adapter, and a cap hook.
3) The retrieval of these tools enables her to remove the hubcap from the wheel, unscrew the lug nuts using the wrench, and lift the car using the jack.
4) Lifting the car with the jack allows her to remove the flat tire and replace it with the spare wheel.
5) After replacing the tire, she secures the spare wheel, which leads to her tightening the lug nuts.
6) Tightening the lug nuts is followed by lowering the car back down and placing the hubcap back on the wheel.
7) Finally, she closes the trunk and stands in front of the car again, likely summarizing the process or providing additional tips, which results in her walking away from the car.
