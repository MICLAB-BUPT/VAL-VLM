1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'How to apply wallpaper' on a blackboard-like background, causing the woman in a red shirt and green apron to introduce the topic while standing in front of a wall filled with wallpaper rolls.
2) After the introduction, she points to various tools laid out on a table, which prepares her for the demonstration, leading her to stand next to a white wall to explain the preparation process for wallpaper application.
3) She uses a power drill to create holes in the wall, followed by mixing a substance in a blue bucket, which causes her to paint the wall with a roller brush, laying the foundation for the wallpaper.
4) Then, using a paint roller, she applies glue to the wall, ensuring it is evenly spread, which enables her to carefully place the wallpaper onto the glued area.
5) Smoothing out the wallpaper with her hands to remove any air bubbles, she then uses a yellow tool to press down the edges, making sure it adheres properly to the wall, resulting in a seamless application.
6) Finally, she trims the excess wallpaper around the edges of the wall using scissors, leaving a neat finish, which leads to the conclusion of the tutorial.
7) The video concludes with a man in a red shirt and green apron thanking viewers for watching and providing information about Dunings Warehouse services, summarizing the process and offering additional support.
