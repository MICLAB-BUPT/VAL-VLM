1) A woman in a blue tank top and shorts is standing next to a man, initially looking at a sign with several small blue squares on it, where the woman is holding a piece of paper, and the man is pointing at the sign.
2) The scene changes, and now the man, who has changed into a black vest and white hat, is throwing darts at a board, with the same woman standing next to him, still holding the piece of paper.
3) After the man hits the board with a dart, the woman takes the paper from the man and walks away, indicating that the action of the man hitting the dartboard causes the woman to leave with the paper.
