1) The group of people, dressed in casual outdoor attire, carry inflatable tubes towards the river, which is caused by their intention to engage in a water activity.
2) They carefully navigate the steps leading down to the water, ensuring they maintain balance while carrying their tubes, which is done to prevent accidents and prepare for entering the river safely.
3) Once at the river's edge, they place their tubes into the water and begin floating downstream, an action enabled by the natural flow of the river and their successful placement of the tubes.
4) As they float, they occasionally adjust their positions on the tubes, some lying flat while others sit up, actions that are taken to ensure comfort and stability during the ride.
5) The calm river with gentle currents allows them to drift leisurely, causing a relaxing and enjoyable experience, complemented by the picturesque setting of lush greenery and rocky formations along the riverbanks.
