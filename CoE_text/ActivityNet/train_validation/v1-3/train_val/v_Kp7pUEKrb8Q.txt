1) The video starts with a close-up of a glass jar filled with the Brazilian lemonade, accompanied by lime slices and a green straw on a blue surface, which sets the scene for the recipe demonstration.
2) The introduction of the recipe and ingredients through text graphics causes the viewer to understand what will be needed and the steps involved in the preparation.
3) A person's hands slicing limes on a wooden cutting board is shown, which is the first step in preparing the lemonade, causing the release of the lime's juice and flavor necessary for the drink.
4) Pouring water into a blender with the sliced limes, then adding sugar, causes the mixture to start forming the base of the lemonade, blending the flavors together.
5) Adding condensed milk to the blender enhances the sweetness and creaminess of the drink, which, when combined with the previous ingredients, creates a more complex and rich flavor profile.
6) Dropping ice cubes into the blender before blending causes the mixture to become cold and smooth, ensuring that the final product is refreshing and well-mixed.
7) Blending until smooth, then straining the mixture through a sieve into a pitcher, removes any pulp or seeds, resulting in a silky texture and clear appearance of the lemonade.
8) Finally, pouring the blended lemonade into a glass jar, garnished with a slice of lime on top, and served with a green straw, presents the drink in an appealing manner, ready to be enjoyed.
