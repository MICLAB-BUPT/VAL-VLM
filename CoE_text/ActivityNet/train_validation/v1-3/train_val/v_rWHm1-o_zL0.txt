1) The video starts with a close-up of a shiny floor, transitioning to a medium shot of cleaning supplies on a table, indicating the setting and tools for the upcoming cleaning process.
2) A person in blue gloves (later identified as a man in a blue shirt and dark pants) is seen mopping the floor, initiating the cleaning process, which causes the need to place a wet floor sign to indicate caution to others.
3) The person then pours a liquid from a bottle into a measuring cup, and also adds a green substance, mixing both with water in a bucket, preparing a solution that will be used for thorough cleaning.
4) They proceed to mop the floor again using the prepared solution, ensuring thorough cleaning, which necessitates the use of a vacuum cleaner afterwards to remove any remaining dirt or debris, further enhancing cleanliness.
5) After vacuuming, the person rolls up a carpet, possibly to clean underneath it or to let the cleaned area dry, and they also take the time to clean a chair with a cloth, addressing all aspects of the room's cleanliness.
6) The person then washes a mop head under running water and places it back in the bucket, maintaining the cleanliness of their equipment, and finally, they wash their hands at a sink, concluding the cleaning process and personal hygiene.
