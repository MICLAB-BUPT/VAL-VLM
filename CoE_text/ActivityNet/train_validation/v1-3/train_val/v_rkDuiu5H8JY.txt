1) The video begins with the model's hair being sectioned into four parts, which is done to organize the hair and prepare it for braiding.
2) The stylist then starts creating a French braid at the top of the head, adding pieces until reaching the ear, which causes the braid to gradually form and secure the hair in place.
3) After reaching the ear, sections of the braid are brought towards the face and pinned, which leads to the formation of the crown shape around the head.
4) Each braid is secured with pins as the process continues through all sections, ensuring that the braids stay in place and maintain the desired structure.
5) The final step involves pinning the braids together at the back of the head, which results in a neatly finished and stable braided crown hairstyle.
