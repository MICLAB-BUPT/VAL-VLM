1) The young girl, dressed in a pink top and black polka dot pants, decides to play on the monkey bars at an outdoor playground.
2) This decision causes her to approach the purple playground equipment and start swinging from one bar to the next.
3) As she swings, her physical action of using her arms to propel herself forward allows her to move across the bars.
4) The movement across the bars, combined with her determination and focus, leads to an observable enjoyment as she plays.
