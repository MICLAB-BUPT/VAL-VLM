1) The video shows a person using a specialized tool to remove the valve cap from a yellow wheel, which is the initial step to access the valve stem.
2) After the valve cap is removed, the person then uses the AME-51025 Quick Valve Change Tool to insert into the valve stem hole, causing the valve stem to be loosened by twisting the tool.
3) Once the valve stem is loosened, it is removed from the rim, allowing for the old valve stem to be replaced.
4) A new valve stem is inserted into the rim and secured in place, completing the replacement process. Throughout the demonstration, text overlays provide information about the AME-51025 Quick Valve Change Tool and contact details for All Tire Supply.
