1) The woman decides to perform a hoop dance, causing her to choose an appropriate location and outfit.
2) She chooses an outdoor area with a large banyan tree, which causes the setting to be surrounded by lush greenery and have a sandy ground.
3) The woman dresses in a black and gold outfit with a patterned skirt (or a black and white outfit with her hair pulled back), causing her to look prepared for the performance.
4) She begins to spin the hula hoop around her body, using various techniques such as spinning it on her arms, legs, and neck, which causes her movements to appear fluid and graceful.
5) The natural lighting from the sun casts shadows from the tree's branches onto the ground, enhancing the visual appeal of the performance.
