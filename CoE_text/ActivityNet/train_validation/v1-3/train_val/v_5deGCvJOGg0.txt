3) The scene transitions to a stage where two men are performing, one playing guitar and singing into a microphone, which results in the depiction of the man also participating in the musical performance, playing the guitar on stage with two other men.
4) Throughout the video, there are brief shots of a man in a white jacket with red accents, possibly giving instructions or commentary, causing an interaction with the main individual and others in similar attire.
5) These interactions cause the man to be shown walking along the rink, conversing with others, and posing for photographs, leading to the video ending with a group photo of several people standing together outside, some holding brooms.
