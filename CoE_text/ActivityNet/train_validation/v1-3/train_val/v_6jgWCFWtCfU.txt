1) A group of people, who are part of a marching band, are participating in a parade. This participation is the cause for them to be dressed in matching uniforms and playing various instruments.
2) The uniforms, which consist of blue and white with red accents, are worn by the band members, indicating their affiliation and creating a cohesive appearance. The wearing of these uniforms is caused by the need for uniformity and representation during the performance.
3) The band members are playing instruments such as drums, cymbals, and brass instruments like trumpets and trombones, and some are holding pom-poms. The use of these instruments and props is to produce music and add to the visual appeal of their performance, which is a direct result of their role in the parade.
4) They are marching in formation, maintaining a steady rhythm, down a street, which is lined with parked cars and has an urban setting with buildings and greenery or mountains in the background. The environment and the specific location of the parade route are the reasons for the presence of these elements.
5) The daytime lighting highlights the energy and coordination of the band as they perform their routine, and this natural light is what allows the clear visibility and recording of their performance.
