1) The woman cleaning the wall causes the surface to be free of dirt and debris, which is essential for the wallpaper to adhere properly.
2) The man spreading a drop cloth on the floor and filling a tray with water prepares the area for the installation, preventing any potential mess and providing the necessary tools for the process.
3) Measuring and marking the wall for the wallpaper application ensures that the panels will be installed in a straight line and with the correct dimensions, leading to a neat and professional-looking result.
4) Soaking the wallpaper in water activates the pre-pasted adhesive, making it ready for application onto the wall.
5) Carefully unfolding and aligning the soaked wallpaper with vertical guide lines causes the wallpaper to be placed correctly, ensuring a seamless and aligned pattern across the wall.
6) Applying the wallpaper panel to the wall and smoothing out any air bubbles results in a smooth and bubble-free surface, enhancing the overall appearance of the wallpaper.
7) Ensuring proper adhesion during the application of each panel prevents the wallpaper from peeling or coming loose in the future.
8) Installing additional panels while maintaining alignment and a wrinkle-free finish creates a cohesive look across the entire wall.
9) Trimming the excess at the top and bottom edges after all panels are applied leaves a clean and polished edge, completing the installation.
10) Wiping away residual adhesive from the edges as a final step ensures that the finished project looks clean and professional.
