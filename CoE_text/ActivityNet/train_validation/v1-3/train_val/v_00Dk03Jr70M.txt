1) The man, dressed in white clothing and a cap, is engaged in the renovation or construction work of a room.
2) He is using a trowel to apply plaster to a wall, which is partially covered, revealing some areas with a yellowish base color, indicating that the process is ongoing.
3) To reach higher sections of the wall, the man stands on a ladder, allowing him to spread the plaster evenly across the surface.
4) The presence of a container (or bucket) of plaster mixture nearby causes the man to occasionally dip his trowel into it, ensuring he has enough material to continue working.
5) Stacks of bags labeled 'ПВХ' are placed on the floor near the window, suggesting these materials are intended for use in the renovation or construction project, possibly for future application or mixing.
