1) The video showcases a swimming class for babies, where infants are seen learning to swim with the assistance of adults, which causes the scene to be set in an indoor pool with clear blue water and bright lighting, creating a welcoming atmosphere.
2) Because the babies are dressed in colorful swimwear, some wearing goggles, and the adults wear swimsuits, it allows for the instructor, a woman in a black swimsuit, to guide the babies through various swimming exercises.
3) As the babies are shown floating on their backs, kicking their legs, and moving underwater, this results in the water's surface being occasionally disturbed by splashes from the babies' movements.
4) The adults support the babies by holding them securely while they practice swimming, which leads to the capturing of the joy and excitement of the babies as they experience swimming for the first time.
