1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text "membrillo films" in white font, which then transitions to another black screen with the name "Mateo Bervelillo" in white font.
2) This causes the scene to shift to an outdoor courtyard where a man in a dark shirt and light pants walks towards two wooden chairs and a small table, instead of a wooden box on the ground.
3) He sits down on one of the chairs, not the wooden box, and the camera zooms in on his face as he looks around, but he does not start playing a drum at this point.
4) The man then stands up and walks away from the chair, leading to another man in a red shirt entering the courtyard through a door.
5) They both sit on the chairs, facing each other, and the man in the red shirt starts playing a drum placed between them, rather than sitting on the ground.
6) A third man in a green shirt joins them, sitting on a chair and playing a drum, increasing the number of people playing drums together from two to three.
7) All three men continue to play their drums together, creating a rhythmic beat, with the camera capturing their hands and feet as they play, similar to the focus on movements and expressions in the second answer.
8) The video ends with a black screen, consistent with how it began.
