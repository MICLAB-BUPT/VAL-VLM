1) A man in a red shirt and green/dark pants is using a pressure washer to clear leaves from his backyard, which is the cause of the leaves being moved.
2) The force of the water from the pressure washer, as he methodically moves it back and forth, causes the leaves to be blown away, creating a cloud of debris that disperses into the air.
3) As the man continues to spray the leaves while walking backwards, this action leads to the gradual clearing of the yard, moving further into the yard as he progresses.
