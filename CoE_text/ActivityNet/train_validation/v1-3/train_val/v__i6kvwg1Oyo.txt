1) The video begins with a close-up view of a dartboard mounted on a brick wall, which has several darts stuck in it and a piece of paper taped to the top.
2) A hand reaches into the frame and removes the paper from the dartboard, causing the camera to zoom in on the darts, showing their sharp points and the damage they have caused to the paper.
3) After the removal of the paper, a person's hand, wearing a ring and a watch, reaches out to remove the darts from the dartboard, indicating that the person might be male.
4) The hand carefully pulls out each dart one by one, starting from the top and moving downwards, causing the dartboard to become empty except for the remaining darts.
5) The darts are then placed on a white sheet of paper below the dartboard, resulting in the final shot of the video showing the now mostly empty dartboard.
