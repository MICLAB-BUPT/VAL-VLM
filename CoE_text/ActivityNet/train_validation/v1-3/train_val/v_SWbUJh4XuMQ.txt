1) The person is using a welding torch to join two pieces of metal, which causes the metal to melt and fuse together.
2) As the welding torch makes contact with the metal, it emits bright sparks and intense light, causing the surrounding area to be brightly illuminated.
3) To protect themselves from the intense heat and light, the welder is wearing protective gear, including gloves and a helmet, which prevents potential injuries.
4) The welder carefully guides the torch along the seam of the metal pieces, ensuring a strong and secure weld, which results in the creation of a glowing seam between the two pieces.
