1) The video features a woman in a gym setting, wearing a black tank top and black shorts.
2) She starts by sitting on the mat with her legs bent and feet flat on the floor, which causes her to transition to lying down on her back.
3) Lying down on her back leads to her lifting her legs off the ground while keeping them straight, causing her to perform leg lifts.
4) Performing leg lifts involves alternating between raising one leg at a time and both legs together, which demonstrates controlled movements and engages her core muscles.
5) Throughout the exercise routine, she also performs leg lifts with her knees bent at a 90-degree angle, maintaining a steady rhythm, which further strengthens her core and leg muscles.
