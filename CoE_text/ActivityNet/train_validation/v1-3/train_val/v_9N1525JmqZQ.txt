1) The video begins with a view of a fireplace under renovation, featuring cardboard panels taped to the walls and a concrete base.
2) A person wearing a white tank top and beige shorts is seen working on the project, which causes them to apply plaster or cement along the edges of the fireplace using a trowel, ensuring an even layer.
3) After applying the plaster or cement, the individual uses their hands to smooth out the surface, causing the preparation for the next step.
4) The individual then places a piece of patterned tile (or in another instance, a piece of cardboard) onto the plastered surface, pressing it down firmly to secure it in place.
5) Throughout the process, they use their hands to smooth out the plaster and adjust the tiles (or cardboard) for proper alignment, causing the completion of that section of the renovation.
