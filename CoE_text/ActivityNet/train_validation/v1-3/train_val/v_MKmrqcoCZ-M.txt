1) The video features a male fitness instructor in a gym setting, wearing a blue tank top and black shorts with white stripes on the sides.
2) The instructor starts by sitting up straight, then lies back onto the mat while keeping his knees bent at a 90-degree angle, which causes him to be in the correct starting position for performing stomach crunches.
3) With his hands placed behind his head, supporting his neck, he lifts his upper body towards his knees in a controlled motion, causing the engagement of his abdominal muscles effectively.
4) Throughout the demonstration, he emphasizes the importance of proper form and technique, which leads to more effective and safer abdominal exercises.
