1) A person is seated in front of three conga drums, wearing a white top and a gray hat.
2) The person is playing the drums with their hands, which causes the creation of rhythmic beats.
3) The room has plain walls and minimal decor, which focuses attention on the drummer's performance.
4) The even lighting suggests an indoor setting without strong natural light sources, which enhances the visibility of the performance.
5) The congas have wooden bodies with metal hardware, and the drumheads appear to be made of animal hide or a similar material, which contributes to the sound produced when struck.
6) The video shows a woman using her hands to strike the drumheads rhythmically, which leads to the alternation between different drums while maintaining a steady beat.
