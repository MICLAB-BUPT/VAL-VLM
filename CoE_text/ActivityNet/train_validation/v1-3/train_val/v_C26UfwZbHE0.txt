1) The video begins with a girl in a blue shirt standing in front of green lockers, talking to another girl.
2) This scene transitions to the same girl walking down a school hallway, passing by lockers and other students, which causes her to encounter a boy holding a bouquet of yellow flowers.
3) The boy appears to be asking her out, but the girl responds by holding up two bottles of mouthwash, one labeled 'Morning Breath' and the other 'Clean BUT NOT!', causing the boy to look surprised.
4) She then proceeds to use the mouthwash in a bathroom sink, spitting it out into the sink, which leads to her continuing to talk about the mouthwash.
5) The video ends with the girl holding the mouthwash bottle again, with text on the screen reading '1-800-BREATHE'.
