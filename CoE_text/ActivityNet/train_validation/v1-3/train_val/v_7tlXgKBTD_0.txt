1) The woman, dressed in a purple tank top and teal pants, begins her exercise routine by lying flat on her back on a gray exercise mat, which is set up in a room with wooden flooring and plain walls.
2) This initial position causes her to prepare for the upcoming abdominal exercises, ensuring that her body is aligned properly on the mat.
3) She then lifts her legs and bends her knees at a 90-degree angle, setting herself up for the next phase of the exercise, which involves engaging her core muscles.
4) The bending of her knees and lifting of her legs leads to her lifting her upper body slightly off the ground while keeping her hands behind her head, further preparing her body for the crunch.
5) This setup causes her to perform a crunch, where she lifts her head and shoulders higher, directly engaging and strengthening her abdominal muscles.
6) Throughout the entire sequence, her movements are controlled and deliberate, which causes her to effectively target and strengthen her core muscles.
