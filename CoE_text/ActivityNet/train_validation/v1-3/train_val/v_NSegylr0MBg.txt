1) The video begins with a man in a bathroom, wearing a black shirt and having tattoos on his arms, which leads to him drying his hair with a towel.
2) Drying his hair with a towel causes him to then use a blow dryer to style it, following the instructions that appear on the screen such as 'blow dry your roots into the direction you want your hair to stay' and 'bigger the hair, blow dry closer to god... blow dry hair UP!'.
3) Using the blow dryer and a brush to create volume causes him to continue styling his hair, using his hands to shape it and lift sections.
4) Shaping his hair with his hands ensures it stays in place, leading to him applying pomade from a small container labeled 'Anchors Hair Co. Shape Maker Pomade'.
5) Applying the pomade causes him to work it through his hair, styling it upwards and back, and finally using a comb to finish the look.
6) Finishing the look with a comb results in the video ending with a black screen displaying the text 'bam! hello nurse!' followed by the website 'www.loveanchors.com' and product details for the 'Anchors Hair Co. shape maker pomade - $12 handmade - water-based - hold 4 / shine 4 smells better than puppy breath'.
