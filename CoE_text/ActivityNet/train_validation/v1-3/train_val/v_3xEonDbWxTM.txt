1) A woman in a red shirt is standing in front of a wall, holding a metal bowl.
2) She is talking and gesturing with her hands, which indicates she is explaining something, possibly about the wall or the contents of the bowl.
3) Her explanation causes her to turn around and start to clean the wall with a cloth, suggesting that the explanation is related to the cleaning process.
4) While cleaning, she continues to talk, indicating that her action of cleaning the wall is part of her demonstration or explanation.
5) The use of the cloth to apply a substance (possibly paint or plaster) to the wall, rather than just cleaning, suggests that her initial explanation and subsequent actions are connected to a renovation or maintenance task.
