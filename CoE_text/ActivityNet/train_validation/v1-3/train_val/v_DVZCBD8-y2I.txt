1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'xclusiveautoworks Long Island's Finest Detailing Services' and 'How to safely clean snow off of your car.'
2) A hand then appears, picking up a blue microfiber towel from a white surface, which causes the scene to transition to an outdoor setting where a car is parked in the snow.
3) Text on the screen instructs to warm up the car and turn on the defrosters, which leads to the person using the blue microfiber towel to gently brush snow off the car's hood, ensuring not to scratch the paint.
4) The person folds the towel over a black brush, which allows for the effective and careful removal of snow from the car's hood, roof, and windshield without damaging the paint or glass.
5) After the demonstration, the video concludes with a black screen displaying the same text as at the beginning, along with additional information about the company's website and social media handles.
