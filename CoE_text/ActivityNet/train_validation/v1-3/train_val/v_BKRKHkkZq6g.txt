1) In a well-lit gym with various exercise equipment, one man, wearing a black t-shirt and red shorts, is standing while holding a large black exercise ball above his head.
2) The other man, dressed in a turquoise t-shirt and pink shorts, is seated on a weight bench and performs sit-ups, reaching up to touch the exercise ball held by the standing man.
3) The standing man lowers the ball slightly each time the seated man completes a sit-up, which causes the seated man to have to reach further, thereby increasing the intensity of his workout.
4) After several repetitions, they both stand up and exchange high-fives, indicating the completion of their exercise set.
