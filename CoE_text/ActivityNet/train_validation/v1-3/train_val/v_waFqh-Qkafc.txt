1) The video begins with a close-up of a pumpkin on newspaper, setting the scene for the carving process.
2) The person starts by cutting the top of the pumpkin, which causes the insides to be accessible for cleaning.
3) Cleaning out the pumpkin's insides follows, preparing the pumpkin for the design application.
4) A stencil of the Panther logo is then placed and taped onto the pumpkin, allowing for accurate tracing.
5) Tracing the design onto the pumpkin using the stencil and a marker creates a guideline for carving.
6) Carving along the traced lines of the stencil begins, leading to the gradual formation of the Panther logo.
7) As the carving progresses, the logo becomes more defined, bringing the design closer to completion.
8) Finally, lighting up the pumpkin from within illuminates the carved design, highlighting the completed Panther logo.
