1) The video starts with a white screen transitioning to a logo featuring a green tree and the text 'PHS' with the tagline 'PLANTING SEEDS. GROWING LIVES.'
2) It then displays 'Basic Tree Care: A HOW-TO GUIDE' followed by 'Chapter 2: Mulching,' which introduces the topic of the instructional content.
3) The scene shifts to a person kneeling beside a tree, indicating the start of the demonstration on how to properly mulch a tree.
4) The video lists the materials needed for this chapter, including 'Organic Mulch,' 'A rake,' 'A hand trowel,' and 'A large brown bag,' preparing the viewer for the steps to follow.
5) The person uses these tools to prepare the ground, removing weeds and grass, which is necessary to ensure the mulch can be spread directly over clean soil.
6) Using a rake, the person spreads mulch evenly around the tree's base, causing the mulch to cover the area effectively.
7) They further distribute and level the mulch with their hands, ensuring it covers the soil properly, enhancing the even distribution initiated by the rake.
8) The person also uses a hand trowel to dig into the soil near the tree trunk, possibly for better access or to adjust the soil, which allows for more precise placement of the mulch.
9) The video concludes with a wide shot of the tree surrounded by a neatly spread layer of mulch, emphasizing the importance of proper tree care, as a result of the actions taken.
