1) The video starts with a black screen displaying the website 'WWW.TRAINERGORRES.COM' and Twitter handle '@TRAINERGORRES' in white text, which transitions to two men standing in a gym.
2) The presence of the two men in the gym, one wearing a blue t-shirt and the other in a black t-shirt with a logo, sets the stage for a training session, causing the man in the blue t-shirt to begin performing a half kneeling cable chop exercise on a machine labeled 'MUSTANG'.
3) The man in the blue t-shirt's action of starting the exercise causes the trainer, who is in a black t-shirt, to provide instructions and corrections, ensuring that the exercise is performed with proper form.
4) The guidance from the trainer causes the man in the blue t-shirt to demonstrate proper form while pulling the cable diagonally across his body from a low to high position, engaging his core and upper body muscles.
5) The completion of the exercise demonstration and the overall training session causes the video to end with another black screen displaying the same website and Twitter handle as before.
