1) In a backyard setting, an adult and a child are engaged in raking leaves. The adult, wearing a green sweatshirt and blue jeans, is using a rake to gather the fallen leaves into a pile.
2) The child, dressed in a blue jacket with white sleeves and brown pants, is also participating by picking up leaves and placing them into the pile, but at times, the child is playing by throwing the leaves around.
3) The ground is covered with a mix of red, orange, and yellow leaves, indicating it's autumn, which causes the need for the raking activity.
4) There's a wooden fence in the background, and a large wooden barrel (or planter) is visible on the right side of the frame, establishing the setting as a typical residential backyard.
5) The lighting suggests it's daytime with overcast skies, providing a comfortable environment for the outdoor activity.
