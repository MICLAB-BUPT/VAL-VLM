1) A man is trimming a hedge using an electric hedge trimmer, cause he wants to maintain the appearance of the hedge.
2) He starts by cutting the lower part of the hedge and moving upwards, cause this method ensures that the hedge will be evenly trimmed.
3) The man then moves to the side of the hedge, continuing to trim from top to bottom, cause he needs to reach different sections of the hedge for a thorough trim.
4) He adjusts his position and angle as needed, cause it allows him to reach all areas and maintain precision in his work.
5) After ensuring the sides are well-trimmed, he carefully trims the top of the hedge, making sure it is even and neat, cause a well-maintained top completes the overall look of the hedge.
6) The man takes his time and pays attention to detail, cause he aims to achieve a symmetrical and perfect appearance for the hedge.
