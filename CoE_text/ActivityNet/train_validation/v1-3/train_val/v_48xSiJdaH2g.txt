1) The video begins with a woman in a white shirt and blue jeans peeling off wallpaper from a wall, which causes the underlying floral pattern to be partially revealed.
2) She then applies a liquid solution to the wall using a spray bottle, ensuring even coverage, which softens the wallpaper and makes it easier to remove.
3) After applying the solution, she uses a red tool to scrape the remaining wallpaper, causing the wallpaper to come off more easily and revealing more of the floral pattern underneath.
4) This step-by-step process, including peeling, applying solution, and scraping, is part of a demonstration of how Wallwik products simplify the wallpaper removal process.
