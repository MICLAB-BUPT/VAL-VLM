1) The man, dressed in a blue t-shirt, gray shorts, and black athletic shoes, is in a well-equipped gym with various exercise machines and weights, which provides the necessary environment and tools for his workout.
2) He chooses to perform a kneeling dumbbell press, causing him to position himself on one knee with the other leg bent at a 90-degree angle, supporting himself on his hands, indicating the specific form and stability required for this exercise.
3) Holding a dumbbell in each hand initially at chest level, he then raises them above his head in a controlled motion, which causes the engagement and strengthening of his shoulder muscles, the primary focus of the exercise.
4) This lifting and lowering motion of the dumbbells from chest height to over his head, then back down, is repeated, causing a consistent and effective workout for his shoulders.
