1) The video begins with a person sitting on an inflatable tube at the top of a snowy hill, preparing to slide down, while other people are also seen sitting on yellow and blue inflatable tubes, wearing winter clothing such as jackets, gloves, and hats.
2) The individuals are then pushed down the hill by others, which causes them to start sliding down the slope at high speed.
3) As they start sliding, the camera captures their feet moving forward, showing the motion and speed of the descent, including close-ups of their faces and feet, as well as wider shots of the snowy landscape and surrounding trees.
4) The environment is a winter landscape with snow-covered ground and trees in the background, and the sky is clear blue, indicating good weather conditions for outdoor winter activities.
5) The surrounding area includes other people enjoying similar activities, with some standing and others seated on tubes, and the video also shows signs indicating the direction and rules for the tubing area, such as 'ARRÊT DE LAVENTURE' (Stop at Laventure) and 'Piste AVEC BOSSES TOUTE LA NUIT' (Slopes with bumps all night).
6) The person continues to slide down the hill, passing by other participants, and eventually reaches the bottom where they come to a stop.
