1) The video shows a person wearing a life jacket and shorts, being pulled on a makeshift water sled or board by a rope, which is attached to a boat, causing them to glide over the ocean's surface.
2) The person appears to be enjoying themselves initially as they are being pulled through the water, but the choppy waves cause the individual to struggle to maintain balance on the surfboard.
3) The struggle to keep balanced, combined with the force of the water and the pull from the boat, eventually causes the person to fall off the surfboard into the water.
