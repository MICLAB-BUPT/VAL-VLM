1) The woman is riding a camel in an outdoor setting, which causes her to hold onto the reins and enjoy the ride.
2) The presence of a saddle on the camel's back and a man in a purple shirt guiding it suggests that this is a guided tour or activity, which leads to the woman feeling secure and relaxed during the ride.
3) The slow walking pace of the camel allows the woman to look around at her surroundings, including trees, bushes, and a clear blue sky, which enhances her enjoyment of the experience.
4) After the ride, the woman dismounts the camel with assistance from another person, which then leads to them both interacting with the camel, petting, and feeding it.
