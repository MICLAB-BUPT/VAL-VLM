1) The video begins with a woman standing in front of a mirror, wearing a black top and black pants, and the background shows a bathroom with a wooden door and floral wallpaper, while in another version, the woman is seen wearing a yellow shirt with the text 'WAYNE BOUND'.
2) The woman starts to brush her long, straight hair that reaches down to her waist using a black comb and a round brush, which causes her to section off her hair.
3) She uses a hairdryer to dry her hair, which leads to her applying a hair product from a small bottle.
4) After the application of the hair product, she uses a curling iron to curl her hair, section by section, in one scenario, whereas, in the other, she uses a hair straightener to style her hair.
5) The use of different styling tools (curling iron or straightener) causes a variation in the final hairstyle, with one resulting in curly hair and the other in straightened hair.
6) In the first scenario, she ties her hair up into a ponytail and puts on a blue headband, concluding the demonstration of her hair care routine.
