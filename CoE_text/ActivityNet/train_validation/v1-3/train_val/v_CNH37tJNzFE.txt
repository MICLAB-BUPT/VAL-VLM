1) The person opens the trunk of the car and retrieves a spare tire and a lug wrench, which is the initial step to prepare for changing the flat tire.
2) They use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire, which allows them to remove the flat tire later.
3) After loosening the lug nuts, they use a hydraulic floor jack to lift the car off the ground, which causes the wheel to be accessible for removal and replacement.
4) With the car elevated, they remove the flat tire, which clears the way for the spare tire to be installed.
5) They place the spare tire onto the wheel hub, which is the action that directly replaces the flat tire with a functional one.
6) Finally, they tighten the lug nuts using the lug wrench, ensuring the spare tire is securely attached, which completes the process and ensures the safety and functionality of the vehicle.
