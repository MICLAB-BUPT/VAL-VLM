1) The video starts with two women, Shelly and Anna, standing in a room, one holding a large piece of fabric, which is identified as a large, colorful rug intended for the living room.
2) They discuss the fabric, causing them to then proceed to clear the space and lay it out on the floor, arranging it in a desired pattern.
3) After laying out the tiles in the desired pattern, they demonstrate how to adhere squares together using adhesive squares, leading to the attachment of the tiles.
4) The action of attaching the tiles causes the next step, where they place the carpet over the furniture and adjust it to fit properly within the room.
5) Finally, after adjusting the rug, they stand up and present the finished look of the room, showcasing the newly laid carpet.
