2) The celebration scene is followed by an image of a car with the text "THE PREMIER V THE DIESEL" displayed below it, which leads to a live-action shot of a sports game, likely hurling, where players are running and competing for the ball, and one person in a blue and white uniform is seen running towards the camera.
3) The scoreboard indicating "WATERFORD 0-13 2-15 TIP" and the cheering crowd cause the players to be seen celebrating on the field, which then shifts to a stage where a man is speaking into a microphone, surrounded by other people.
4) This causes the inclusion of scenes of people dancing and singing on a stage, with various individuals performing and interacting with each other, as well as images of a dog wearing a shirt, leading to a celebratory atmosphere.
5) The video concludes with another title screen displaying "mySpace.com/Laughphonic & laughbebo.com" in blue neon-like font against a starry background, which serves as the final visual.
