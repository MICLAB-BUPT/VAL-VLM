3) As the boat speeds up, this causes the skier to lose balance and fall into the water.
4) After falling, the skier emerges from the water, appearing wet but unharmed.
5) The camera then captures the person swimming back to the shore, where they are greeted by another individual who appears to be waiting for them.
