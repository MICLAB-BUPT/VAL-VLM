1) The video features a small, brown and white dog with long fur being groomed by a person wearing a blue shirt.
2) The person is using a white electric clipper, which is held close to the dog's body, to trim the dog's fur, causing the removal of excess hair as the clipper is moved gently over the dog's fur.
3) The action of grooming causes the dog to appear to be enjoying the process, as it is seen smiling and panting with its tongue out.
