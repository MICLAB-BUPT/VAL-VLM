1) The video shows a person solving a Rubik's Cube, which causes the individual to hold the cube in their hands and manipulate it with quick, precise movements.
2) The person rotates the layers of the cube, aiming to align all the colored squares on each face, which is caused by their high level of skill and familiarity with the puzzle.
3) The person, who is wearing a white shirt with purple text and has long brown hair, is seen against a background that appears to be a plain wall or door, but this does not directly cause the actions taken to solve the Rubik's Cube.
