1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the project, which causes the viewer to understand the context of what will follow.
2) A woman is seen kneeling on the floor, preparing to paint the table, which leads to her applying a coat of green paint to all surfaces, including the legs and underside of the table.
3) She meticulously covers all surfaces, causing the camera to capture close-up shots of her hands as she applies the paint, ensuring even coverage.
4) After one coat, she sands the edges to reveal the wood underneath, creating a distressed look, which is then followed by the application of furniture wax to the painted surface, enhancing its finish.
5) The application of furniture wax using a cloth leads to the enhancement of the table's finish, showcasing the transformation of the table from its original state to a beautifully painted piece of furniture.
6) The video concludes with a display of the finished table, now painted in a light green color with distressed edges, placed against a brick wall backdrop, which is the result of all the previous steps.
