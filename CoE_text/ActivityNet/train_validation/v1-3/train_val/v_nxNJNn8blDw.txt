1) The video shows a carpet installation process in a living room, where initially, the room is empty with a green underlayment laid out on the floor.
2) The workers start by removing the old carpet, then prepare the floor by laying down the green underlayment, which causes the surface to be ready for the new carpet.
3) Three workers unroll and cut beige carpet over the underlayment, causing the new carpet to cover the entire floor of the living room.
4) They use tools like a staple gun and a hammer to secure the carpet in place, which ensures that the carpet is firmly attached and does not move or bunch up.
5) After the carpet is laid out, they vacuum it to remove any debris, which results in a clean and presentable new carpet.
6) The workers proceed to install baseboards along the walls, which enhances the finished look of the room.
7) Finally, they bring in and reposition the furniture, including a large sectional sofa and a coffee table, back into their original places, which completes the transformation of the room from an empty space to a fully furnished living area.
