1) The video starts with a man kneeling beside a tree in a garden, wearing a blue shirt and khaki pants.
2) He is seen touching the soil around the base of the tree, which causes him to possibly inspect or prepare it for maintenance.
3) His actions suggest he might be demonstrating proper gardening techniques or explaining something related to the tree care process, causing him to then demonstrate how to apply mulch around the tree's base.
4) He carefully spreads the mulch evenly, and the camera zooms in on the tree trunk and the surrounding soil, showing the texture and color of the mulch.
5) The man continues to explain the process, gesturing towards the soil and the tree, which leads to a close-up shot of his hands as he pours mulch from a bag onto the ground around the tree, ensuring an even distribution.
