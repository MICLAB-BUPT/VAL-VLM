1) The person, wearing gloves, is holding the leaf blower with both hands, which causes the leaf blower to be activated and generate a strong airflow.
2) The activation of the leaf blower and the generated airflow cause the dry, brown leaves on the grassy area next to the sidewalk to be blown into the air, onto the sidewalk, and into the street.
3) The person's action of moving the leaf blower back and forth along the sidewalk causes the leaves to be systematically cleared from the sidewalk and curb, further pushing them into the street.
