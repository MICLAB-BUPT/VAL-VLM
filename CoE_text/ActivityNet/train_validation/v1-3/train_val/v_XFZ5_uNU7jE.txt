1) The person is peeling potatoes in a kitchen sink, using a peeler to remove the skin, which causes the peeled potato skins to fall into the sink.
2) The metal sink is filled with water, where the potatoes are placed, causing the peeling process to be conducted over the water.
3) A cat is sitting on the edge of the sink, watching the person peel the potatoes, and its interest in the peeling process causes it to occasionally reach out to touch the potatoes.
4) The person continues to peel the potatoes, and this ongoing activity causes the cat to remain engaged in observing the process.
