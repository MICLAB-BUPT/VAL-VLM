1) The video begins with a close-up of a green and white baking mat on a kitchen counter, setting the scene for baking.
2) A person wearing an apron is seen preparing to bake cookies, which causes them to place dough onto the mat in small portions.
3) They use a spatula to transfer the dough portions onto a baking tray, causing the tray to be ready for baking.
4) The person places the tray into an oven and closes the door, causing the baking process to start.
5) Later, they open the oven door to reveal freshly baked cookies, which causes them to remove the tray from the oven and place it on the counter.
6) The person then transfers the cookies from the tray to a plate, resulting in the cookies being ready for consumption or display.
7) Afterward, they wash the baking mat in the sink using a sponge and water, causing the mat to be clean and ready for reuse.
8) Finally, the person uses the now-clean mat to roll out dough for making macarons, which are then piped onto the mat, causing the preparation for the next batch of baked goods to begin.
