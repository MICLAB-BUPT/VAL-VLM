1) The video showcases a woodworking project in progress, where a person is seen working on a wooden surface, which appears to be part of a larger piece of furniture or structure. This setting causes the individual to apply a substance, likely wood filler or glue, onto the surface using a putty knife, spreading it evenly across the area to cover any gaps or imperfections.
2) After ensuring the surface is smooth and free from imperfections, the man, now standing in the workshop and holding a paintbrush and a can of paint, begins the next step. His deliberate actions cause him to apply a coat of paint to the workbench, using his hands to smooth out the paint for an even application. 
3) The completion of the first coat of paint causes the man to add more layers, carefully spreading each one across the surface. Throughout the process, the workspace remains cluttered with various tools and materials, indicating the ongoing nature of the project. The man's focused and deliberate actions are aimed at achieving a smooth and even finish on the workbench.
