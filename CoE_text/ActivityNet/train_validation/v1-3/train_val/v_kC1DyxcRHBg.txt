1) The video begins with a close-up of a kitchen sink, where a person wearing pink gloves is seen pouring baking soda into the sink. This action is taken to prepare the surface for cleaning.
2) The person then sprays vinegar onto the baking soda, causing a foamy reaction which helps in breaking down grime and dirt on the sink.
3) They proceed to scrub the sink with a sponge, focusing on different areas to ensure thorough cleaning, which removes the loosened dirt and grime from the sink's surface.
4) After scrubbing, the person rinses the sink with water from the faucet, ensuring all cleaning agents are washed away, thus removing any remaining residue and preventing potential damage or discoloration caused by leftover cleaning products.
5) Finally, they dry the sink with a paper towel, leaving it clean and shiny, which prevents water spots and ensures the sink looks its best.
