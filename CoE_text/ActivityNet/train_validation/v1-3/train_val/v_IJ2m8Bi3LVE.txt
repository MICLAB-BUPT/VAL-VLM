1) The video begins with a close-up of a person's face, focusing on their eyes and nose. The person has long black hair and is wearing makeup, including dark eye shadow and lipstick.
2) This causes the scene to transition to a black screen with the text "Setting Up Your Lenses" in white letters, indicating the start of the instructional part of the video.
3) As a result, various items needed for applying contact lenses, such as contact lens solution, a contact lens case, and a piece of tissue paper, are displayed on a table.
4) Consequently, the person's hands are shown handling these items, including opening the contact lens case and pouring the solution into it.
5) Following this, the person uses a dropper to apply the solution to the contact lenses, which prepares them for insertion.
6) This action leads to the person inserting the contact lenses into their eyes, first by placing the lens on their finger, then gently pulling down their eyelid to insert the lens, and repeating the process for the other eye.
7) After successfully inserting both contact lenses, the video shows the person's face with the contact lenses now in place, demonstrating the final look.
8) Finally, the video ends with a black screen displaying the text "Lots of designs to choose from" in white letters, suggesting a variety of options available for viewers.
