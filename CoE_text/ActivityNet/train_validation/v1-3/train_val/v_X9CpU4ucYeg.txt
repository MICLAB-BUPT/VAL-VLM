3) The extracted lemon juice is then poured into a pitcher, which is filled with water.
4) Next, she heats water with sugar on the stove, stirring it until dissolved, causing the creation of a sugar syrup.
5) The sugar syrup is subsequently poured into the pitcher that contains the lemon juice and water, enhancing the flavor and sweetness of the mixture.
