1) A man and a young girl are at a zoo, preparing to ride a camel.
2) The man helps the girl onto the camel's saddle while holding her securely, causing them both to be seated on a saddle-like structure attached to the camel's back.
3) They then ride the camel along a path, guided by a zookeeper who leads the camel with a rope, causing the camel to walk slowly along a dirt path surrounded by greenery and wooden fences.
4) The man and girl enjoy the ride, smiling and looking around as they pass by other animals in enclosures, suggesting that the experience is a positive and entertaining one for them.
