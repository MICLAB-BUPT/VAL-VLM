1) The man in a black shirt and gray shorts is seen smoothing out a large white sheet or cloth on the floor, possibly preparing it for hanging.
2) This preparation causes the man to move towards a window area where a woman is standing on a chair or stool, ready to assist him in hanging up the sheet or cloth.
3) The man then climbs onto a ladder, holding the now prepared curtain in place, while the woman assists him from below, which leads to them carefully aligning the curtain with the window frame.
4) Their careful alignment and teamwork cause the curtain to hang straight and evenly, completing the task of decorating or covering the window.
