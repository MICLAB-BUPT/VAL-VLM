1) The man in a blue shirt and jeans opens a can of paint, which causes him to pour the contents into a tray.
2) Pouring the paint into the tray enables him to use a roller to apply primer to a wall, ensuring it is evenly spread.
3) After applying the primer, he prepares adhesive by mixing it in a tray, causing him to be ready to apply it to another section of the wall.
4) Applying the adhesive to the wall leads to hanging non-woven wallpaper, where he carefully aligns the wallpaper with any existing pattern on the wall to ensure it is straight and properly adhered.
5) Once the wallpaper is applied, his decision to start removing it from the wall, beginning at the top corner and working down, is facilitated by using a tool to assist in peeling off the wallpaper smoothly.
