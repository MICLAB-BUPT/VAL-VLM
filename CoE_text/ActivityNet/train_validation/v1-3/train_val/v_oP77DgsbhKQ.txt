1) The man in a yellow shirt and jeans starts by preparing the adhesive, mixing it with water and powder to create a smooth consistency, which causes the adhesive to be ready for application.
2) The preparation of the adhesive causes the man to apply it onto the floor using a notched trowel, ensuring an even spread, which in turn creates a suitable surface for the tiles to adhere to.
3) After applying the adhesive, the man measures and marks the tiles for cutting using a measuring tape and a pencil, which allows him to make precise cuts along the marked lines with a tile cutter, resulting in tiles that fit the space accurately.
4) The act of cutting the tiles along the marked lines causes the man to then place the tiles onto the adhesive, aligning them carefully to ensure proper spacing and alignment, which leads to a neat and uniform pattern.
5) By pressing down on the tiles with his hands, the man secures them in place, which is a result of the previous steps and ensures the tiles are firmly attached to the adhesive and floor.
6) Throughout the process, the man explains each step, providing tips and techniques, which helps viewers understand the process and potentially achieve a professional-looking tile installation.
