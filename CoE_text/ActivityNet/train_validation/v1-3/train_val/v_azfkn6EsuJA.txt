1) The person in a blue shirt is working on a pair of skis in a cluttered garage workshop, which is dimly lit with overhead fluorescent lights.
2) The individual first uses an electric sander to sand or smooth the surface of the skis, indicating that they are preparing the skis for further maintenance, which causes the need for the next step.
3) After smoothing the skis, the person then applies wax to them using a yellow waxing tool, moving it back and forth over the surface, to ensure the skis are well-maintained and ready for use.
