1) The video starts with a black screen displaying the website and product name, which causes the introduction of Melanie, a professional stylist, seated in a salon chair.
2) Melanie introduces herself and the products she will use for a blow-dry tutorial, which leads to her holding two pink bottles labeled 'my amazing blow dry secret' and explaining their features.
3) After the explanation, Melanie stands in front of a mirror and sprays the product onto her wet hair, causing her to begin the demonstration of the blow-drying process.
4) She uses a round brush and a white hairdryer, focusing on different sections of her hair while looking into the mirror, which allows her to continue talking and explaining each step of the process.
5) Throughout the video, the timer at the bottom right corner counts up, showing the duration of the blow-drying process, leading to the conclusion where Melanie stands still, facing the camera, and the timer reaches 18 minutes and 2 seconds.
