1) The video shows a person in a workshop setting, working on a ski. They are using various tools to scrape and smooth the surface of the ski's base, which causes the ski to be prepared for further maintenance.
2) After preparing the ski, the person transitions to performing maintenance on a snowboard. This involves scraping off the old wax from the board's surface using a tool, which leads to the removal of any existing wax and debris.
3) Once the old wax is removed, they use a yellow sponge to clean the board thoroughly, causing the surface to become free of any remaining dirt or residue.
4) Following the cleaning, they apply new wax to the board and spread it evenly across the surface, which ensures that the snowboard will have a fresh, protective layer.
5) The application of new wax is followed by the use of a brush to smooth out the wax, ensuring an even distribution and causing the wax to set properly on the board.
6) Finally, they use their hands to further refine the waxing process, making sure the board is ready for use, which results in a well-maintained snowboard that is prepared for optimal performance.
