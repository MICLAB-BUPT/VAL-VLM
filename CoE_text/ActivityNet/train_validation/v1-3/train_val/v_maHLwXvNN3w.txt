1) The man, wearing sunglasses and a shirt (described as dark-colored in one account and green in the other), is seated behind a set of conga drums, which are orange with white bases and have a green cross on them, causing him to be the central focus of the video.
2) He holds drumsticks in each hand, leading to him starting to play by tapping the drums lightly.
3) His playing gradually increases in intensity, resulting in fluid and rhythmic movements as he performs different patterns on the drums.
4) The setting is an indoor location with natural lighting from a window, creating a warm atmosphere, and this causes the background to be clearly visible, including a staircase, a fan, and a computer monitor.
