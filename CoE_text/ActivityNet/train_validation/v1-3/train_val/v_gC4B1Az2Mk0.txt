1) A young boy is sitting on a mat in front of a doorway, eating ice cream from a small container. He is shirtless and wearing gray shorts.
2) A woman in a patterned dress walks by him, which does not interrupt his activity, causing him to continue eating his ice cream.
3) The boy then switches to eating the ice cream from a metal plate, indicating that he might have transferred the ice cream or was given another serving, possibly by the woman who walked by.
4) He picks up a piece of ice cream with his hand and eats it, showing his method of consumption.
5) The woman in the patterned dress walks by again, but this event does not cause any change in the boy's actions; he continues to eat his ice cream.
6) An adult woman approaches him and hands him a plate with more food, which leads to the boy continuing to eat, now from the plate, occasionally looking up at the camera.
