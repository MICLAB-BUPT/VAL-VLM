2) He carefully aligns it with the edge of the wall, causing the wallpaper to be positioned correctly.
3) The man then smooths out the wallpaper, ensuring it adheres properly to the wall, which prevents air bubbles or wrinkles from forming.
4) He continues this process, pressing the wallpaper firmly against the wall, making sure it is evenly spread and free of imperfections, which results in a clean and professional appearance.
