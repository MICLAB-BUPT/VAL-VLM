1) The video features two men in a gym setting, which causes the scene to be set in an environment with equipment like weights, benches, and a large fan.
2) One man, wearing a black t-shirt and yellow shorts, is lying on the floor, while the other man, dressed in a dark grey t-shirt and black shorts, stands beside him, causing the standing man to appear as if he is instructing or coaching the man on the floor.
3) The man on the floor starts by lying flat with his knees bent and feet flat, which leads to him lifting his legs up to a 90-degree angle, keeping his back straight.
4) After lifting his legs, he performs a leg raise exercise, which involves lifting his legs straight up towards the ceiling, then lowering them back down to the starting position, causing a series of exercises to be performed.
5) Throughout the video, the standing person is seen observing and possibly providing guidance or instructions, which results in the man on the floor being coached through various exercises such as leg lifts and crunches.
