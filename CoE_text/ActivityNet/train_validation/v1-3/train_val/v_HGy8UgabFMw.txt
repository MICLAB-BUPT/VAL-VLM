1) The man starts by standing on the ground, carefully shaping the lower parts of the hedge, which causes him to establish a foundational shape for the trimming.
2) As he progresses and needs to reach higher sections, he climbs a green ladder, which allows him to access and trim the upper areas of the hedge, ensuring even trimming throughout.
3) The man works methodically, moving from one section to another, which causes the entire hedge to be neatly shaped and evenly trimmed. Occasionally, stepping down to adjust his position or to trim lower areas further ensures that no part is overlooked.
