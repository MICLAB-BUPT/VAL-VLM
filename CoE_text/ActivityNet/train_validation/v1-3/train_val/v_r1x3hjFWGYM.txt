1) The video begins with a title screen that reads "How to put in contacts", setting the stage for the instructional content.
2) This causes the scene to transition to a person washing their hands under running water, which is a necessary step to ensure hygiene and prevent eye infections.
3) After washing hands, the scene shifts to the person sitting at a table, opening a blister pack of contact lenses, indicating the start of the actual lens insertion process.
4) They remove one lens from the pack and hold it between their fingers, preparing for the next step, which leads to them bringing the contact lens towards their eye and placing it on their fingertip.
5) The person then proceeds to insert the contact lens into their eye, following instructions displayed on the screen, which guides them through the correct technique.
6) After inserting the first lens, they repeat the process for the other eye, ensuring both eyes have the lenses properly inserted.
7) The inclusion of text overlays providing instructions for each step throughout the video helps to clarify and reinforce the actions being performed.
