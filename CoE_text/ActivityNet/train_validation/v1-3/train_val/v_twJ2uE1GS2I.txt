1) The video features a woman in a kitchen setting, wearing a purple top and an apron, who begins by explaining the process of making a simple chocolate cake.
2) She measures and mixes ingredients like flour, cocoa powder, sugar, eggs, and butter, causing the creation of a smooth batter. The flour is sifted high above the bowl to ensure it is aerated, which contributes to the texture of the cake.
3) The batter is then poured into greased or parchment-lined cake pans, leading to the preparation for baking. 
4) The pans are placed in an oven, resulting in the cakes being baked.
5) After baking, she removes the cakes from the oven, allowing them to cool on a wire rack, which prepares the cakes for frosting.
6) Once cooled, she spreads frosting between the layers and tops the cake with more frosting, leading to the assembly of the cake.
7) Finally, she dusts powdered sugar over the finished cake, completing the decoration and presentation of the chocolate cake.
