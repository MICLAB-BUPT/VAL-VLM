1) The video depicts a room with yellow walls and a fireplace on the left side, initially with a bare floor except for a few scattered items.
2) A man enters the room carrying a large roll of carpet, which causes him to unroll it across the floor.
3) After unrolling the carpet, he cuts it to size using a utility knife, causing the excess material to be removed.
4) He rolls up the excess material and secures it with tape, then places it against the wall.
5) Another person joins him, and they both work together to spread out the carpet evenly, which leads to them using tools like a hammer and a level to ensure the carpet is properly aligned and flat.
6) The man in the white shirt works near the fireplace while the other man focuses on the center of the room, causing the carpet to be adjusted and secured, making sure it fits snugly around the fireplace and corners.
7) Finally, they vacuum the newly installed carpet to remove any loose debris, which results in the room being clean and ready for use.
