1) The man begins by preparing the floor, which involves cleaning and smoothing it out, causing a suitable surface for tile installation.
2) He then mixes materials in buckets, likely for adhesive or grout, using a drill mixer, which is necessary to create the proper consistency for application.
3) The mixed material is applied onto the floor with a trowel, creating a smooth surface for tile placement, ensuring the tiles will adhere properly.
4) Subsequently, he cuts tiles using a saw and a manual tile cutter, ensuring precision in size, so that the tiles fit perfectly against the walls and in the designated spaces.
5) The man meticulously places the cut tiles onto the prepared floor, aligning them carefully and using spacers between the tiles to maintain even gaps, which contributes to a uniform and aesthetically pleasing appearance.
6) After placing the tiles, he applies grout between the tiles for a finished look, filling in the gaps left by the spacers and providing structural integrity.
7) Finally, he cleans the surface of the tiles with a sponge, removing any excess material, thus leaving the tiles clean and the project looking professionally done.
