1) A man in a wheelchair is seated in a living room with a fish tank and a couch visible in the background, wearing a blue t-shirt, ripped jeans, and a black cap, and he has tattoos on his arms.
2) The man reaches for a white sneaker on the couch beside him, which causes him to hold the sneaker in his right hand.
3) Holding the sneaker, the man begins to talk and gesture, explaining something about the sneaker, which leads to him demonstrating how to put on and take off the shoe.
4) As part of the demonstration, he puts the shoe on his right foot, adjusting it to fit properly, and this action causes him to lift his left leg onto the armrest of the wheelchair to better show the process.
5) After putting on the shoe, he takes it off, showing the process of removing it from the foot, and throughout the entire demonstration, he uses hand gestures to emphasize certain steps.
