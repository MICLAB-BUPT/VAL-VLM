1) The video begins with a title card that reads 'Cómo hacer' (How to do) in red and black text on a white background, surrounded by various icons, which introduces the tutorial's theme.
2) This introduction causes the scene to transition to a woman standing against a white wall, holding a hula hoop, setting the stage for the demonstration.
3) The woman, wearing a green top, gray cardigan, and gray pants, starts the demonstration by holding the hoop and then spinning it around her waist, moving her hips in a circular motion to keep the hoop spinning, which is the fundamental technique of hula hooping.
4) As she demonstrates, the presence of other objects such as a blue hoop, a red hoop, and a red carpet on the floor in the background adds context and variety to the setting, enhancing the visual appeal and providing additional tools for the demonstration.
5) After demonstrating the basic technique, the video shows different people using hula hoops in various settings, including a grassy field and an outdoor event, which broadens the viewer's understanding of where and how hula hooping can be enjoyed.
6) The woman then proceeds to demonstrate different advanced techniques for using the hula hoop, including spinning it around her neck and arms, building upon the initial skill and showing the versatility of hula hooping.
7) The demonstration concludes with the woman holding two hula hoops, one red and one green, and explaining how to use them simultaneously, which is the final step in the progression from basic to more complex hula hooping skills.
