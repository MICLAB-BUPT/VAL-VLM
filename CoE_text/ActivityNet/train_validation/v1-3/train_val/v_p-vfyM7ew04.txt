1) The person in a red shirt and black apron begins by applying wax to the ski's base using a brush, which is the initial step in preparing the ski for maintenance.
2) After applying the wax, they use a red and white iron to spread the wax evenly across the ski, causing the wax to melt and cover the surface uniformly.
3) Following the ironing, they wipe the ski with a cloth, which causes the removal of any uneven or excess melted wax, ensuring a smooth surface.
4) They then apply more wax with their hands, further enhancing the coverage and protection of the ski, which is a cause for achieving a thorough maintenance.
5) The process of applying wax, ironing, wiping, and reapplying is repeated several times, leading to the ski being well-maintained and thoroughly covered in wax.
6) Finally, they use a small tool to scrape off excess wax from the ski's surface, resulting in a clean and well-prepared ski ready for use.
