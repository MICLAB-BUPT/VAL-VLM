1) The video shows a group of people attempting to flip a car on its side, which causes the car to drive normally initially in a desert-like environment.
2) Suddenly, the car flips onto its side, causing the individuals inside to be thrown around.
3) They then try to stabilize the car by pushing against it from the outside, but this action causes the car to continue rolling over several times as they struggle to control it.
4) Eventually, the car comes to a stop, and the individuals climb back into the vehicle, seemingly unharmed but visibly shaken, which leads to them engaging in an activity or challenge involving the overturned car.
5) As part of this activity or challenge, some individuals manage to get on top of the flipped-over vehicle while others remain outside.
