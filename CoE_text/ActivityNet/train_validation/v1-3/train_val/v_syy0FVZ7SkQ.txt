1) The man in a red shirt and dark pants standing in a dining room, holding a mop, causes him to start demonstrating how to use the mop on a wooden floor.
2) The demonstration of the mop's use around the room leads to him transitioning to a kitchen area where he washes the mop head under running water at the sink.
3) After cleaning the mop head, it causes him to return to the dining room and continue mopping the floor.
4) Completing the mopping and demonstration results in the video ending with a black screen displaying the website 'www.microfiberwholesale.com' for more information about microfiber mops.
