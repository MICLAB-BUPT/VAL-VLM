1) The man prepares his tools and materials, including an iron, wax, brushes, and a ski, which cause him to be ready for the tuning process.
2) He cleans the base of the ski using a brush and a cloth, causing the surface to be free from dirt and old wax, which is essential for effective wax application.
3) He applies wax to the ski's base using the iron, ensuring even distribution, which causes the wax to melt and adhere properly to the ski, providing a smooth and efficient gliding surface.
4) After cooling the wax for at least an hour, he scrapes off the excess wax with a scraper, causing only the necessary amount of wax to remain, thus optimizing the ski's performance.
5) He brushes the ski to remove any remaining wax residue, causing the ski to have a smooth, clean finish, which is crucial for its functionality on the snow.
6) Finally, he wipes down the ski with a cloth, causing it to be clean and ready for use, ensuring that no unwanted particles or residues are left on the ski.
