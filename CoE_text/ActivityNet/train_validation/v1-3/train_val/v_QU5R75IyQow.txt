1) The video begins with Alexander Samerets introducing himself and the tutorial, which causes the audience to understand the context and purpose of the video.
2) This introduction is followed by a woman getting her hair washed in a salon sink, which prepares her hair for styling and makes it easier to manage.
3) The stylist then dries the woman's hair using a blow dryer and brush, creating curls, which is necessary to achieve the desired texture and shape for the final hairstyle.
4) After drying, he uses a curling iron on sections of her hair, ensuring each strand is curled correctly, which further enhances the curl definition and adds to the overall style.
5) He applies hairspray to set the style, which helps in maintaining the curls and preventing them from falling out.
6) Next, he styles the hair into three braids, securing them at the base of the head, which creates the foundation for the voluminous, styled updo.
7) The braids are secured with pins, which ensures that the hairstyle stays in place and maintains its form.
8) Finally, he sprays more hairspray to finish the look, which seals the entire hairstyle, making sure it lasts longer and looks polished.
