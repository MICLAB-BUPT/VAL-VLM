1) The man starts by pushing the lawnmower across the grass, moving from one side to the other, which causes visible lines from the lawnmower to appear on the freshly cut grass.
2) After reaching the end of the yard, the man turns around, and this action allows him to continue mowing in the opposite direction.
3) By repeating the process of mowing back and forth, the man ensures he covers the entire lawn area, resulting in a uniformly cut backyard enclosed by a wooden fence, under the sunny day's lighting.
