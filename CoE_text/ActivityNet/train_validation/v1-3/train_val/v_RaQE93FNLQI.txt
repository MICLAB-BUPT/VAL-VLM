1) In a well-lit kitchen, an adult and a child are baking cookies. The adult, wearing a plaid shirt, is rolling out dough on the counter with a rolling pin while the child, in a polka-dotted top and red pants, watches attentively.
2) The child then assists by pressing cookie cutters into the dough, which causes the adult to use a star-shaped cutter to cut out cookies from the rolled-out dough.
3) The child assists by placing the cut-out cookies onto a baking tray, which leads to the adult carefully arranging the cookies on the tray, ensuring they are evenly spaced.
4) After placing all the cookies on the tray, the adult sprinkles colorful sugar crystals over them, and the child helps by holding the tray steady as the adult continues to sprinkle the sugar.
5) They both then decorate the cookies with colorful icing, with the adult guiding the girl in decorating the cookies, ensuring they are evenly covered with icing.
