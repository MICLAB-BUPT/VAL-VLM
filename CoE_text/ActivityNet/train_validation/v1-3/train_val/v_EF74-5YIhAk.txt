1) The video opens with two individuals, one in a red life vest and the other in a black shirt, preparing for a kayaking trip by loading kayaks onto a car, which causes them to then carry the kayaks to the water's edge on a sandy shore by a lake.
2) The man helps the woman launch her green and yellow kayak into the lake, and this action is followed by him launching his own white kayak, causing both of them to start paddling away from the shore.
3) As they move further out, the camera captures them from different angles, emphasizing their kayaking skills and the serene lake setting, which leads to the conclusion of the video with credits rolling over a still image of the kayakers on the shore, with text indicating 'Directed By Vann Hilly.'
