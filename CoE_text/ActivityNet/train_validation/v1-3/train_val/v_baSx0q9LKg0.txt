1) The video begins with the preparation of the cake batter, which is caused by cracking eggs into a bowl, adding sugar, and mixing them together using an electric mixer.
2) After the initial mixture is well combined, adding flour to the mixture and pouring it into a pan or chocolate mold is the next step, caused by the need for a solid base for the cake.
3) Baking the prepared batter in the oven, which is caused by the requirement to cook the ingredients and form the sponge base of the cake, follows.
4) Once baked and cooled, cutting the cake into squares and placing them into a chocolate mold occurs, caused by the desire to create individual servings and prepare for the coating process.
5) A creamy filling or mixture being spread over the cake, or melted chocolate being poured over the cake squares, is then done, caused by the intention to add flavor and texture, as well as to cover the cake.
6) Finally, removing the chocolate-coated cake from the mold and presenting it as a finished dessert happens, caused by the completion of the chocolate setting and the readiness of the dessert for serving.
