1) The video showcases a red Lincoln Electric Arc Welder in a workshop environment, with the welder prominently displayed and its control panel explained.
2) The importance of setting the correct voltage and amperage for different materials is emphasized, which causes the person to adjust these settings on the control panel before beginning the welding process.
3) A person sets up the arc welder by connecting it to a power source via a thick black cable, then connects it to a metal frame on the ground, ensuring everything is connected properly.
4) After the setup, the person puts on safety gear, including a welding mask, to protect themselves from the sparks and intense light that will be produced during the welding.
5) The person starts using the welder, holding the welding torch and applying it to the metal pieces, which causes sparks to fly as the metal parts are being joined together.
6) Carefully moving the welding torch along the metal joints, the person creates a strong bond between the pieces, completing the demonstration of how to properly use the equipment.
