1) The decorator rolls out and places green fondant on the cake, which causes the base of the landscape to be established.
2) Blue fondant is then applied to create a sky-like effect, causing a contrast with the green land and setting the scene for the rest of the decorations.
3) White fondant clouds and a yellow sun are added, which enhances the sky's appearance and adds depth to the overall design.
4) Brown fondant is used to represent land, causing the definition between the sky and ground to become more apparent, contributing to the landscape's realism.
5) Green fondant trees and red fondant flowers are added for detail, which causes the scenery to look more vibrant and lively.
6) A small pig figurine is placed on top of the cake, which serves as the focal point of the decoration, adding a playful element to the design.
7) Additional details like a number '3' and a small black dot are added using a tool, which personalizes the cake and provides specific significance or meaning.
8) Finally, painting facial features on the pig figurine and adding a small black dot to the sky completes the decoration process, resulting in a fully detailed and visually appealing cake.
