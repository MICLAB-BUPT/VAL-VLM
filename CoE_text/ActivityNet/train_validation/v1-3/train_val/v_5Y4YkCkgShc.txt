1) The video starts with a man in an orange chef's coat standing in a kitchen, talking to the camera. He introduces himself as Sanjay Thumma.
2) This introduction is followed by him mixing ingredients in a bowl, which causes the preparation of the pancake batter.
3) The batter is then poured onto a hot griddle, causing it to spread out evenly.
4) When bubbles form on the surface, this indicates that the pancake is ready to be flipped, leading him to use a spatula to turn it over.
5) After flipping, the pancake continues to cook until it reaches a golden brown color, signaling that it is fully cooked.
6) The completion of the cooking process prompts the man to pour syrup over the pancake and cut it into pieces with a fork and knife.
7) Tasting the pancake and giving his approval, along with a smile at the camera, signifies his satisfaction with the result.
8) The video concludes with a shot from a different angle, showing the man still talking, indicating the end of the demonstration.
