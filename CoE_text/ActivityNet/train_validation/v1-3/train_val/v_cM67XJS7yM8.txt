2) This embrace between the two women on the ice rink leads to them hugging another person, suggesting a group celebration, which is further supported by the depiction of a group of people celebrating, hugging, and congratulating each other, indicating a moment of victory or achievement.
3) The individuals' attire, consisting of dark clothing with some wearing jackets and others in shirts, along with the presence of curling stones and brooms, suggests that the celebration takes place after a sports event, specifically a curling match, causing the next scene to show players engaged in a curling match, with one player sliding a stone towards the target area while others observe.
