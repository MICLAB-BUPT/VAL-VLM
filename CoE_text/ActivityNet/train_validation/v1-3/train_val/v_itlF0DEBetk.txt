1) The man, dressed in a yellow shirt and blue jeans, begins working on a garden area, which is the setting for his activity.
2) He uses a shovel to take gravel from bags and spread it around the birdbath, causing the gravel to be evenly distributed.
3) To further ensure the gravel is spread evenly, he then uses a rake, causing the surface of the gravel to become smooth and level.
4) The birdbath, which is placed on a circular stone base surrounded by grass and has a decorative design, becomes more integrated into the garden due to the gravel being spread around it.
5) The environment, lush with greenery including trees and bushes, as well as the presence of a parked car in the background, remains constant, providing a natural and familiar backdrop to the man's focused work.
