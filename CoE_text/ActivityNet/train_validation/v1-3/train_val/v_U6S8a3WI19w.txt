The provided answers describe two different scenarios, one involving a beach volleyball game and the other a soccer game on a sandy beach. Since they do not logically connect to form a single event, it's not possible to integrate them into a coherent logical chain as requested. Could you please provide information or context that links these two events, or clarify if you want a logical chain for each event separately?
