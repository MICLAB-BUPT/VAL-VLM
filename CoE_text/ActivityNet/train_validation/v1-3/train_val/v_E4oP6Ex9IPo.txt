1) The video begins with a black screen that transitions to a title card reading 'THE WORKSHOP' in bold yellow letters against a dark background, which then causes the scene to cut to a close-up of a person's hands holding a yellow waxing iron.
2) The text 'TB Waxing Iron' appearing at the bottom left corner leads to the person demonstrating how to use the waxing iron on a ski, applying wax and smoothing it out, while the background shows a workshop setting with various tools and equipment visible.
3) The individual is seen holding the iron with both hands and moving it back and forth over the surface, which ensures an even application of wax across the entire length of the ski, thus continuing the demonstration in a deliberate and focused manner.
4) Throughout the video, the logo 'ellis brighton MOUNTAIN SPORTS' is displayed in the top right corner, indicating the brand or sponsor of the content, until the video concludes with another title card displaying the same logo.
