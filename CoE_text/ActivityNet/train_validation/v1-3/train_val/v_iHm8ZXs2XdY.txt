1) The woman starts by brushing her hair, which causes it to become smooth and tangle-free.
2) After brushing, she gathers her hair into a high ponytail, which is then secured with a hair tie, causing the hair to be held in place.
3) She divides the ponytail into two sections, which allows her to begin the braiding process.
4) As she crosses the sections over each other, adding more hair from the sides of the head, this causes the formation of a fishtail braid.
5) Once the braid is complete, she holds it up for display, which demonstrates the thickness and texture of the braid, causing viewers to see the final result.
