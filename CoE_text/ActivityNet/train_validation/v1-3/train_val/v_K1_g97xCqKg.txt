1) The person in the video begins by focusing on the lawn tractor's wheel, which is in a worn condition with visible cracks and damage, indicating the need for inspection and possible repair.
2) This need for inspection causes the person to remove the tire from the vehicle, allowing for a closer examination of both the tire and the wheel hub.
3) During the inspection, the person, wearing gloves, uses a tool to remove a component, such as a bearing or seal, from the wheel hub, suggesting that the detailed check extends beyond just the tire to include internal parts.
4) The removal and examination of the component, along with the overall inspection, are conducted deliberately and carefully, emphasizing the thoroughness of the process.
5) After inspecting and possibly replacing or reconditioning the removed part, the person reattaches it to the wheel, ensuring all components are correctly positioned and secured.
6) Finally, the tire is placed back onto the vehicle, and the wheel is securely attached to the lawn tractor, concluding the repair and inspection process, which was initiated by the initial observation of the wheel's worn condition.
