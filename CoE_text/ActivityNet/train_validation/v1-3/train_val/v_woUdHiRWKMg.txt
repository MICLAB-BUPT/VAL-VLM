1) The video begins with a red car parked on the side of the road, followed by a person opening the trunk and taking out a spare tire.
2) The person then uses a wrench to loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire, which causes the lug nuts to become easier to remove.
3) After loosening the lug nuts, the person lifts the car with a jack, enabling them to unscrew the bolts holding the flat tire in place and remove it completely.
4) The removal of the flat tire allows the person to replace it with the spare tire.
5) Once the spare tire is in place, the person tightens the lug nuts on the spare tire, securing it properly.
6) Finally, they place the flat tire back in the trunk and close it, concluding the tire-changing process.
