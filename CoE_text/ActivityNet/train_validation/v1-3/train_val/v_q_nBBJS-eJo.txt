1) The video starts with a man in an orange t-shirt standing behind a table, holding a paintbrush and a can of paint.
2) He then picks up a piece of sandpaper and a container of paint, which causes him to apply the paint onto the sandpaper using the brush.
3) After applying the paint, he sprays a white substance onto the sandpaper, leading to the preparation for the next step.
4) This preparation causes him to put on gloves and begin sanding a wooden block with the sandpaper.
5) Throughout the process, there are various objects on the table, including cans of paint, a roll of paper towels, and a spray can, which support his actions.
6) Meanwhile, he also picks up a can of spray paint and a piece of cardboard, causing him to spray the cardboard.
