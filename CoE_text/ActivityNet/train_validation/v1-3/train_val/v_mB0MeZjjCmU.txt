1) The video begins with a close-up of a baked vanilla sponge cake, followed by a shot of ingredients laid out on a wooden surface.
2) The process starts with the person cracking eggs into a bowl and beating them with an electric mixer until they become fluffy, which causes the mixture to incorporate air and increase in volume.
3) Sugar is gradually added to the beaten eggs while continuing to mix, causing the mixture to become even fluffier and pale yellow due to the sugar dissolving and stabilizing the egg foam.
4) In another bowl, flour, baking powder, and salt are mixed together, preparing the dry ingredients for incorporation into the wet ingredients.
5) Milk and butter are heated together in a measuring cup, which causes the butter to melt and blend smoothly with the milk, ensuring even distribution in the batter later.
6) The heated milk and butter mixture is then combined with the egg mixture, causing the temperature of the egg mixture to rise slightly, which will help in activating the leavening agent (baking powder) when it's all mixed together.
7) This combined liquid mixture is poured into the bowl with the dry ingredients and whisked together, causing the formation of a smooth batter that incorporates both the leavening agents and flavorings.
8) Vanilla extract is added to the batter, enhancing the flavor profile of the cake.
9) The batter is then poured into a greased and floured cake pan, preparing it for baking.
10) The cake is baked for 25-30 minutes at 350 F (180 C), during which the heat causes the leavening agents to produce carbon dioxide, making the cake rise and set.
11) Once baked, the cake is removed from the oven and allowed to cool before being served, allowing the structure of the cake to firm up and making it easier to handle.
