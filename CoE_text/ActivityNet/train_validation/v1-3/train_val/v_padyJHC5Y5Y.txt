1) The video begins with a title screen introducing 'The Round Brush Blowout' and a list of required items: blow dryer, round brush, comb, and sectioning clips.
2) A woman is shown combing her wet hair, applying styling product, which causes the hair to be prepped for the blow drying process.
3) She then dries her hair until about 70% dry using a blow dryer while using a round brush, ensuring that the hair is partially dried before sectioning.
4) The woman sections her hair into five parts and pins them up, leaving one section down, which allows for better control and even drying of each part.
5) She uses the round brush and blow dryer on the loose section, pinning it up after drying, which results in extra volume and a more polished look.
6) This process is repeated for each section, causing all parts of the hair to be evenly dried and styled.
7) Finally, she releases the pinned-up sections, letting her hair fall naturally, and showcases the finished blowout hairstyle from various angles, revealing the completed look.
