1) The video starts with a man in a red shirt standing in front of a pile of sand, introducing the topic of plastering.
2) This introduction causes him to demonstrate the use of various tools like a bucket, plaster trowel, and wooden straight edge for plastering.
3) After demonstrating the tools, he then shifts to working on a wall, applying plaster using a trowel and a hawk, which leads to showing how to mix plaster in a bag labeled 'Build It Cement'.
4) Mixing the plaster causes him to apply it to a brick wall, and subsequently, he uses a wooden straight edge to create a smooth finish, ensuring an even surface.
5) Throughout the process, his actions cause him to explain the process, point at different tools and materials, and demonstrate techniques, making the process easy to understand.
