1) The surfer, wearing a wetsuit, is seen paddling out on his surfboard, waiting for the right wave to catch.
2) When the surfer identifies a suitable wave, he starts surfing, skillfully maneuvering his board along the wave's face, which causes him to maintain balance and control, showcasing his surfing skills.
3) As the wave breaks, it causes the surfer to lose his balance, leading to a fall into the water.
4) The fall results in the surfboard flipping over, and the surfer struggles to regain control in the water.
5) Eventually, regaining some control, the surfer manages to get back on the surfboard, which leads to him continuing to paddle through the waves.
