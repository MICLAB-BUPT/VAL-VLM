1) The young man, wearing a white long-sleeve shirt, black pants with white stripes, and white shoes, starts using a red and black leaf blower to clear leaves and debris from a driveway, which causes the leaves to be moved off the concrete surface.

3) As he continues to work, moving around the driveway, this action causes the leaves and debris to be blown into piles, effectively clearing the area.
