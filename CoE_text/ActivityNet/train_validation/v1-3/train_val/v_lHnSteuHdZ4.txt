1) The person in the video is ice fishing, which causes them to initially walk across the snow-covered ice towards a hole in the ice.
2) As they approach the hole, they lower the line into the water, causing them to wait patiently for a fish to bite.
3) After some time, a fish is caught, causing the person to reel it in.
4) The fish is then lifted out of the hole and placed on the ice, leading the person to remove the hook from the fish's mouth.
5) The person uses a net to pull the fish out of the water, facilitating the removal of the hook from the fish's mouth before releasing it back into the water.
