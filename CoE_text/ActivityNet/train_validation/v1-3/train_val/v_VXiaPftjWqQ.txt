1) The video showcases a step-by-step guide on installing a tile floor, with the person in a green and black striped sweater and blue jeans demonstrating the process.
2) The preparation of the floor causes the laying down of an orange underlayment (foam mat), which is then followed by the application of adhesive using a trowel.
3) Applying the adhesive leads to placing tiles onto it, ensuring they are level and properly aligned, with the use of spacers to maintain even gaps between the tiles.
4) To achieve proper placement, the person uses a rubber mallet to tap the tiles into place.
5) The need for precise fitting of tiles around edges or obstacles results in cutting tiles using a tile cutter and a circular saw.
6) After all the tiles are placed, the next step involves the application of grout between the tiles.
7) Cleaning the grout lines with a sponge and a bucket of water follows the grouting, ensuring a neat finish.
8) Sealing the grout with a sealer happens after cleaning, to protect the grout from moisture and stains.
9) Finally, the installation of a toilet in the newly tiled bathroom completes the renovation, indicating the end of the tiling project.
