1) The man, wearing a red hoodie with a peace symbol and the words 'Navy' and 'Park' on it, along with jeans and sneakers, is on a roof, suggesting he is there to perform some maintenance or cleaning task.
2) He is holding a yellow rake-like tool, which is used for removing old shingles from the roof, causing the wooden surface underneath to be revealed, indicating that his initial purpose might also involve preparation for roof repair or replacement.
3) The presence of a yellow broom in addition to the rake-like tool, and his gestures while explaining something, cause the impression that he is not only removing shingles but also engaged in cleaning or clearing debris from the roof.
4) The overcast day with no direct sunlight, combined with the visible brick chimney and trees in the background, provides an environment suitable for such work, as the lack of direct sun may make the task more comfortable and safe.
