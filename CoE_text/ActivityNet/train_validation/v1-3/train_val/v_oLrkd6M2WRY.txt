1) The video begins with a man standing in a garage, holding a large shuffleboard court box.
2) He then moves outside to a sidewalk where he unboxes and sets up the shuffleboard court, which involves unrolling the court and carefully aligning the court pieces on the sidewalk, ensuring they are properly positioned.
3) After setting up the court, he places shuffleboard discs (or pucks) on it.
4) The man then demonstrates how to play shuffleboard by sliding the pucks across the court, moving the discs along it.
