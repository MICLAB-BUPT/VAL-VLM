4) The environment transitions from a rural setting to suburban areas with houses, trees, and well-maintained lawns, leading the skateboarder to continue down the road, passing by parked cars and residential streets, and then shifts to a waterfront promenade where the skateboarder glides along the path beside the water, with a city skyline visible in the distance.
5) The video concludes with the skateboarder reaching a more urban area, riding past buildings and parked cars, eventually coming to a stop near a waterfront, and then walking along a rocky shoreline, with the cityscape still in view.
