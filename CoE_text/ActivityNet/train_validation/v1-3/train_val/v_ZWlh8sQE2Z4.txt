1) A man in a red t-shirt and black shorts is performing a stretching exercise on a gym floor.
2) He starts by kneeling with one knee down, then raises his right arm above his head while leaning to the left side, which causes him to stretch his right arm and the right side of his body.
3) He holds this position for a few seconds, allowing the muscles in his arm and shoulder to extend and relax.
4) After holding the position, he switches to the other side, raising his left arm and leaning to the right, causing a similar stretch on the opposite side of his body.
5) The man repeats this sequence several times, alternating sides, to ensure both sides of his body are equally stretched.
6) His movements are controlled and deliberate, focusing on stretching his arms and shoulders, indicating an intention to improve flexibility or prepare for more intense physical activity.
