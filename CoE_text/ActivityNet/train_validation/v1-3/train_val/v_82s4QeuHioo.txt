1) The video begins with a group of people preparing for white water rafting on the Kundalika River in Koldal, which causes them to wear safety gear, including helmets and life jackets, and get into inflatable rafts.
2) After they are properly equipped and have boarded the rafts, the participants start navigating through the rapids, causing them to paddle vigorously to maintain control of their rafts.
3) As the participants navigate through the turbulent waters, the strong currents toss the rafts around, leading to scenes that capture the excitement and challenges of white water rafting.
4) Throughout the journey, the need to stay afloat and steer through the rapids causes the participants to work together and paddle with great effort.
5) Finally, the successful navigation through the challenging parts of the river leads to the group reaching calmer waters, which results in them celebrating their successful rafting adventure.
