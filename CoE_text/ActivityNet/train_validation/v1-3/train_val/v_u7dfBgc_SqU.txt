1) The video starts with the woman showing her hair in its natural state.
2) This causes her to then either tie it up with a headscarf or remove a headscarf, depending on which sequence is followed.
3) After the headscarf step, she uses a blow dryer to dry her hair while holding and sectioning it, and also uses a brush to detangle the curls.
4) Drying and detangling her hair leads to her styling it by twisting and rolling parts of it into buns on top of her head.
5) Finally, after the buns are set, she lets her hair down, causing the final voluminous, curly hairstyle to be revealed.
