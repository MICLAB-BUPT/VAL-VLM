1) The man, dressed in winter gear including a camouflage jacket and gloves, is ice fishing on a frozen lake, seated on a white bucket.
2) He uses an electric fishing sonar device to locate fish beneath the ice, which causes him to be able to identify where to cast his line.
3) After identifying a potential spot, he catches a small fish using a fishing rod that is connected to the sonar device, reeling it in.
4) Upon successfully reeling in the fish, he removes it from the hook, which leads to him either placing the fish into a black container beside him or holding it up for the camera.
5) In one scenario, he places the fish into the container, while in another, he releases the fish back into the water after removing the hook, indicating a catch-and-release practice.
