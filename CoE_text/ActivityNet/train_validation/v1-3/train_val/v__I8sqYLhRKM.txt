1) In the video, two children are seen raking leaves in a backyard during autumn, which causes them to work together on an outdoor chore.
2) The older child, wearing a blue shirt and jeans, uses a pink rake to gather the fallen leaves, while the younger one, dressed in a pink coat and orange hat, holds a blue rake and also participates, albeit with less coordination, which leads to both of them contributing to the task of clearing the yard.
3) Their actions demonstrate cooperation and engagement in outdoor chores, resulting in the creation of piles of leaves as they go, thus effectively cleaning up the yard for the season.
