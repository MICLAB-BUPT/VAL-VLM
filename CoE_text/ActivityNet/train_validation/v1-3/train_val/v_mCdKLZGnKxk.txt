1) The video shows a person installing a chimney cap on a roof, which initially has a white pipe protruding from it without a cap.
2) Before placing the black chimney cap, the person installs a black vent pipe on top of the roof and uses a caulking gun to apply sealant around the base of the pipe, ensuring it is securely attached and sealed, causing the pipe to be ready for the cap installation.
3) The person then places the black chimney cap over the newly installed pipe and secures it in place, using a caulking gun again to apply sealant around the edges of the cap, which causes a tight seal to be formed.
4) Carefully aligning the cap and pressing it firmly onto the roof shingles ensures that the cap is properly positioned, leading to the final adjustments being made to the cap to ensure it is securely attached and properly sealed.
