1) The video begins with a title screen displaying the Johnstone's logo and the text 'making the most of your home', which sets the context for the DIY project to follow.
2) This is followed by a scene where a woman in a striped shirt and jeans enters a room, causing her to interact with the environment, specifically a white chair, a brick wall, and various painting supplies.
3) The woman kneels down to pick up a cloth from a bucket on the floor, which causes her to prepare for cleaning the chair, indicating the first step in the refurbishing process.
4) She then stands next to the chair, holding a spray bottle and a cloth, preparing to clean the chair, which leads to her using a yellow cloth to wipe down the chair, focusing on different areas, ensuring it is ready for painting.
5) After cleaning, she dips a paintbrush into a can of red paint labeled 'Johnstone's nondri-gloss', which causes her to begin the painting process, applying the paint carefully to the chair's surface.
6) Once the painting is completed, the action of placing a pillow on the painted chair in a brightly colored room with red walls and a red carpet occurs, signifying the completion of the transformation.
7) Finally, the video concludes with another title screen displaying the Johnstone's logo and the tagline 'making the most of your home', reinforcing the brand and the theme of the DIY project.
