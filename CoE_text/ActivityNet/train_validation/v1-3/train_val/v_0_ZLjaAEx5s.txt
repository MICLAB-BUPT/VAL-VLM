1) The video features a person demonstrating how to create goddess braids, which causes the individual to start by parting their hair down the middle using a comb.
2) After parting the hair, the individual sections off portions of their hair and begins braiding it tightly from the roots towards the ends, causing the creation of intricately woven, tight, and neat braids.
3) Once the braids are complete, the individual gathers them into a low ponytail at the nape of the neck, leading to the next step where they twist the ponytail into a bun and secure it with a hair tie.
4) Throughout the process, the use of a brush to smooth out any frizz and ensure the braids are well-defined contributes to the overall neatness and appearance of the hairstyle.
5) In another version, after completing the braids, she twists them into buns at the back of her head, securing them with hair ties, which leads to the final step.
6) Finally, putting on a black hat and posing for the camera allows the woman to showcase her completed hairstyle.
