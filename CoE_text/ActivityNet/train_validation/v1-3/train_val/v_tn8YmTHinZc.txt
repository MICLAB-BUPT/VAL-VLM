1) The woman starts by squeezing lemons into a large container, which causes the collection of lemon juice as the base for the drink.
2) She then adds sugar and water to the lemon juice, causing the mixture to become a basic lemonade.
3) Next, she pours Sprite into the container and stirs the mixture, which causes the creation of a carbonated, sweetened lemonade blend.
4) Finally, she adds strawberries to the drink and places it on the counter, resulting in a visually appealing and potentially more flavorful lemonade with a fruity twist.
