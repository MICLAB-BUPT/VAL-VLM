1) The video starts with a man in a green shirt and sunglasses standing in front of a table filled with various bicycle parts and tools, which causes him to begin explaining the process of assembling a mountain bike.
2) He starts the assembly by picking up a box, opening it, and revealing a bicycle inside, which then leads to him starting the construction with the frame.
3) After setting up the frame, he moves on to the wheels, gears, and handlebars, causing each part to be properly aligned and secured as he demonstrates the correct way to attach them.
4) The man also shows how to attach the pedals and handlebars, and adjust the seat height and position, which ensures that the bike is comfortable and safe for the rider.
5) Throughout the demonstration, he provides tips and tricks for maintaining the bike and keeping it in good working condition, leading to a better understanding of bike care.
6) Once the assembly is complete, he gives a final check to the fully assembled bike, making sure that all parts are functioning correctly, which results in a well-constructed and operational bicycle.
7) Finally, the man stands next to the fully assembled bicycle, showcasing it to the camera, which concludes the instructional video.
