1) A woman wearing a red shirt and white shorts is painting a wooden fence.
2) She is using a paint roller to apply the paint evenly, which causes her to carefully move the roller up and down, ensuring that all areas are covered with paint.
3) The fence is made of vertical wooden planks, and in order to reach the higher parts of the fence, she stands on a ladder.
4) After finishing the higher parts, she then bends down to reach the lower parts of the fence, holding onto the upper part with her other hand for balance.
