1) The video shows a person welding metal pieces together in a workshop environment, which causes the welder to wear protective gear, including gloves and a welding mask.
2) Wearing the protective gear allows the welder to safely begin the process, so they carefully position the welding torch near the metal pieces and start to weld them together, creating bright sparks and flashes of light.
3) As the welder applies the welding torch to the metal surfaces, it results in bright light and smoke, and the welder maneuvers the torch along the joints of the metal pieces, fusing them together.
4) After completing the weld, the action of finishing the fusion prompts the welder to inspect their work by running their hand over the welded area to check for any imperfections or gaps.
