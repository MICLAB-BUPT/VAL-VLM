1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'S.A. WARDEGA presents' in white font, followed by another black screen with the same text and an additional line reading 'press any button', which causes the scene to transition to a game selection screen.
2) The game selection screen shows various character portraits labeled 'SELECT YOUR FIGHTER', with options for 'RANDOM', 'GROUP', and 'HIDDEN' at the bottom, leading to the next frame where two characters, 'KOREN-SAN' and 'GRZYW-CHAN', are displayed in a fighting stance against a fiery background with a loading bar at the bottom.
3) After the loading, the scene shifts to an outdoor setting, causing the appearance of two individuals dressed in inflatable sumo wrestler costumes, who are seen walking towards each other on a roundabout, indicating the start of their mock fight.
4) The characters engage in a playful combat, pushing and shoving each other, which results in one of them being pushed down, and this sequence is repeated in multiple rounds, each time showing the characters in different positions and the text 'KOREN-SAN WIN' or 'GRZYW-CHAN WIN' indicating the winner, thereby adding to the humorous and light-hearted nature of the video.
5) The final frames show the characters standing up and walking away from the roundabout, with a bus passing by in the background, concluding the comedic struggle that had been taking place in an urban area with buildings, cars, and pedestrians around, thus ending the video.
