2) This action then allows them to scoop out the seeds and pulp, causing a clean and hollow space inside the pumpkin.
3) After preparing the interior, they use a knife to carve out the eyes, nose, and mouth of the pumpkin, resulting in the creation of a face on the pumpkin.
4) Carefully carving each feature ensures that it is symmetrical, leading to an aesthetically pleasing design.
