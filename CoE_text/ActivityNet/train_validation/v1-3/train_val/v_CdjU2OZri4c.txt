1) The video begins with a close-up view of the floor, highlighting the contrast between the dark carpet and the light wood, setting the stage for the installation process.
2) A person's hands are seen placing a wooden strip along the edge of the carpet, ensuring it fits snugly, which is the initial step in integrating the two surfaces.
3) The individual then uses a pencil to mark measurements on the strip, and measures the distance between the two surfaces using a ruler, providing precise points for drilling, which causes the next action.
4) Following the marking, drilling holes at specific points occurs, creating spaces for securing the strip, leading to the necessity of cleaning up.
5) After drilling, the person vacuums the area to remove debris, which is caused by the drilling, ensuring a clean surface for the adhesive.
6) They apply adhesive along the edge of the carpet and press the strip firmly into place, a direct result of preparing the surface, aiming to secure the wooden strip.
7) Finally, the person uses a tool to secure the strip further, ensuring a tight fit against the carpet, completing the installation process initiated from the beginning.
