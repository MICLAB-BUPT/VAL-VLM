1) The video begins with two workers on the roof, indicating the start of a maintenance and restoration process, which causes the need for a detailed inspection and preparation of the area.
2) This is followed by a close-up of a roof with broken tiles, which necessitates the cleaning of the surface, causing a worker to spray high-pressure water to clean the roof.
3) After the cleaning, to ensure that the tiles are properly set and sealed, another worker applies cement and re-pointing material to the roof tiles, leading to the next step where an air blower is used to remove any remaining debris from the roof, ensuring a clean surface for further applications.
4) To prevent the growth of algae or moss, a worker then applies a sterilization coat to the roof tiles, which in turn prepares the surface for the application of a sealer coat, sprayed onto the roof to protect it against water and other elements.
5) For additional protection and longevity, a worker applies a second coat of roof membrane, ensuring thorough coverage, which results in the completion of the roof restoration, as evidenced by the final scenes showing the finished roof with a 'SOUTHWEST ROOFING' sign in front of the house.
