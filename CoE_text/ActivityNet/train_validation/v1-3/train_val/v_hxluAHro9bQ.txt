1) The video starts with a title screen on a pink background, introducing the content as 'How to keep a hoop up' by Karen Tiede.
2) This introduction causes the transition to an outdoor setting where a woman in a pink tank top and black shorts is seen standing on grass surrounded by trees, holding a large hula hoop.
3) Holding the hula hoop leads to her demonstrating how to keep it spinning around her waist through moving her hips and arms in a rhythmic motion, which is essential for maintaining the hula hoop's balance.
4) Her focus on maintaining the hula hoop's balance while rotating it around her waist enables her to perform various techniques, including lifting the hoop above her head and spinning it around her body.
5) Demonstrating these techniques results in her showing how to stop the hoop from spinning and pick it up again, further illustrating different hula hooping skills.
6) Throughout the video, she maintains a steady rhythm and demonstrates different hula hooping skills, which leads to the conclusion of the demonstration.
7) The conclusion of the demonstration causes the video to end with another title screen on a pink background, providing additional information about hula hooping, such as where to find more details and how to make a hula hoop for oneself.
