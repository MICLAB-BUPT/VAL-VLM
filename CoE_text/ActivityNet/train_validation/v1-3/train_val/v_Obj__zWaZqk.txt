1) A group of people, mostly wearing blue shirts and jeans, are working together to unload soil from a dump truck.
2) The individuals are using shovels and rakes to scoop the soil out of the truck bed and spread it evenly across the designated area, which is part of a landscaped environment, possibly a park or garden.
