1) A man is using a hedge trimmer to trim a large bush, which causes the hedge trimmer to make a loud noise as it cuts through the branches of the bush.
2) The man is standing on the grass and holding the trimmer with both hands, which allows him to move the trimmer back and forth along the top of the bush.
3) By moving the trimmer back and forth, the man is carefully shaping the bush, which leads to the trimming and maintenance of the bush's appearance.
