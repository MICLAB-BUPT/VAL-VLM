1) The video showcases a group of individuals constructing a sandcastle on Huntington Beach, which causes them to start by building the base with large sand molds and digging and shaping the sand.
2) They carefully remove the molds to reveal a solid structure, which then leads them to use buckets to further create the base of the castle.
3) The team works together, using tools like shovels and rakes to shape and smooth the sand, which in turn allows them to add details like towers and windows using their hands and tools.
