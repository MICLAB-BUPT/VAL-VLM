1) The video showcases a person demonstrating the use of 'Pumpkin Masters' pumpkin carving kits, which causes them to begin by presenting various kits, including 'Pumpkin Masters Carving Kit 360' and 'Pumpkin Masters Carving Kit 400,' each containing different tools and stencils for carving pumpkins.
2) The display of the kit's contents, including the tools and stencils, leads the individual to then show different stencil designs available in the kit, such as 'Halloween Witches,' 'Jack-O-Lantern,' 'Pumpkin Cat,' 'Pumpkin Spider,' and 'Pumpkin Ghost.'
3) After showing the variety of stencil designs, the person carefully places one of the stencils onto a pumpkin, causing them to use a tool to trace the design onto the pumpkin's surface.
4) Tracing the design onto the pumpkin's surface leads to the step where they carve out the design, after which they apply black paint over the carved areas using a brush.
5) Applying black paint over the carved areas results in the final step, where they add a glow-in-the-dark effect to the pumpkin by applying a substance from a small packet.
