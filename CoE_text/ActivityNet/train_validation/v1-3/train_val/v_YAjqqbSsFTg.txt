1) The video begins with a man, wearing a light blue shirt and beige pants, kneeling next to a tree.
2) He is surrounded by mulch and is holding a small object, possibly a tool, indicating he is about to engage in a gardening activity.
3) The man uses his hands and the tool to spread the mulch evenly around the base of the tree, demonstrating a technique or providing instructions related to tree care or landscaping.
4) His actions are deliberate and focused, ensuring that the mulch covers the entire area around the tree trunk, which causes the base of the tree to look neat and well-maintained.
5) After finishing, the man stands up and walks away from the tree, leaving behind a neatly mulched base.
6) The video ends with a shot of a butterfly perched on a flower, symbolizing the beauty and tranquility of nature, which is a result of the man's careful gardening efforts.
