1) The video shows a person sharpening a knife, which is the common goal in both scenarios.
2) In the first scenario, the person uses a belt sander to achieve this, holding the knife against the moving belt and guiding it for even sharpening. This action causes the blade to become sharper as the abrasive surface of the belt removes material from the knife's edge.
3) After several passes on the belt sander, the person inspects the knife's edge to ensure it has been properly sharpened, then cleans the blade with a cloth to remove any debris, which is a step taken to maintain the cleanliness and quality of the sharpened knife.
4) In the second scenario, instead of a belt sander, the person employs a sharpening stone, holding the knife at an angle and moving it back and forth along the stone. This motion, combined with applied pressure, also causes the blade to sharpen by gradually wearing down the metal to form a fine edge.
5) Following the sharpening process with the stone, the person inspects the blade by running their fingers along it, a method used to check for imperfections or unevenness, ensuring the sharpening process was effective.
