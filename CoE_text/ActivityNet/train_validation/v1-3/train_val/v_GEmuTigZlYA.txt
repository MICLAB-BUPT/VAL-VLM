2) The woman, who is wearing a plaid shirt, blue jeans, and sandals, uses a red brush to groom the dog's fur, which causes the dog's fur to become smooth and untangled.
3) She starts the grooming process from the back (and also the neck as per the second answer), moving towards the front (and then towards the back again as mentioned in the second answer), which ensures that the entire fur of the dog is thoroughly brushed.
