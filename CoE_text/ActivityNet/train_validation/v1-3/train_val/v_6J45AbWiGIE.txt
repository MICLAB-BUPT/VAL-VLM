1) The woman in the video is training her dog, Deigian Oompa aka Paco, in disc dog, which causes the dog to become well-trained and responsive to her commands.
2) As part of the training, the woman throws a blue frisbee, causing the dog to eagerly chase after it, catch it mid-air, and bring it back to her, an action that is repeated multiple times throughout the video.
3) The repeated act of fetching the frisbee contributes to the dog's happiness and contentment, as he is also seen playing with a blue tunnel toy and navigating through an agility course with the woman guiding him.
