1) The man, wearing a gray shirt and blue jeans in the first description and a dark-colored shirt and blue jeans with a tool belt in the second, starts by applying adhesive to the wall, which causes the surface to become ready for tile placement.
2) After the adhesive is applied, the man places tiles on the wall, causing the wall to gradually transform from its original teal or greenish hue into a tiled surface.
3) To ensure that the tiles are properly aligned, the man uses tools to adjust and secure them, which causes the tiles to be straight and evenly spaced.
4) As he works, the man carefully measures and cuts the tiles as needed, causing any gaps or edges to be accurately filled and matched, ensuring a professional finish.
5) The man's methodical movement from one section of the wall to another, combined with his focus and attention to detail, causes the tiling process to proceed smoothly and efficiently, leading to the successful completion of the wall tiling.
