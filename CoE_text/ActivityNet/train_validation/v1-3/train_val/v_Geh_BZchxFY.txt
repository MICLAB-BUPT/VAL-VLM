1) The video shows a person preparing ingredients in a kitchen or dining area, where they start by peeling and cutting small potatoes with a knife.
2) This action of peeling and cutting the potatoes causes thin strips of potato skin to be created, with several peeled potatoes visible on the table.
3) After dealing with the potatoes, the person then shifts their focus to peeling garlic cloves, still using the knife, which is caused by the need for multiple ingredients in the recipe they are preparing.
4) The person holds each garlic clove in one hand while using the knife in the other to carefully cut off the outer layer, causing the garlic to be peeled and ready for use.
5) The peeled garlic is then placed on a white cloth or napkin, an action that is repeated for each garlic clove, indicating a meticulous preparation process.
