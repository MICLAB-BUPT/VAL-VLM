1) The video begins with a person removing a small metal object, likely a valve, from the tire rim, which is a necessary step to prepare the tire for the changing process.
2) After the removal, the person uses the LINCO U-221A tire changing machine by pressing down on the pedal and rotating the wheel, causing the tire to be separated from the rim, thus allowing access to the inner surface of the tire.
3) Next, the person positions the tire onto the machine's platform, a step that is crucial for facilitating the subsequent operations such as spreading grease and repositioning the tire.
4) The application of grease on the tire's bead (or inner surface) follows, which is done to reduce friction and make the mounting process smoother, thereby preventing damage to the tire during the mounting.
5) With the tire properly greased, the person then moves it back and forth over the machine's platform while using a lever to rotate the tire in a clockwise direction, causing the tire to be mounted back onto the rim effectively.
6) Finally, after the tire has been successfully remounted, the person places the valve back into the tire and checks the air pressure using a gauge, ensuring the tire is inflated to the correct pressure, which is critical for safety and optimal performance.
