1) A woman in a light blue tank top, black leggings, and blue sneakers is in a gym setting to perform a barbell exercise.
2) She starts by positioning herself on a pink mat, kneeling with her right knee bent and left leg extended behind her, which causes her to be in the correct starting position for the exercise.
3) Holding the barbell with both hands across her thighs, she then lifts the barbell up to her chest, keeping her back straight and core engaged, which demonstrates proper form and technique.
4) The controlled and deliberate movements, emphasizing strength and stability, cause her to repeat the motion several times, further reinforcing her technique.
5) The gym environment, with red curtains hanging from the ceiling and various pieces of equipment visible in the background, provides the setting where the exercise takes place.
