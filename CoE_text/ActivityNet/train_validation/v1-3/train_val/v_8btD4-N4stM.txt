1) The video begins with a bull being led into an arena, which causes the bullfighting event to start.
2) In the arena, the bull charges at the matador, who dodges and maneuvers around it using a red cape, causing the bull to become more agitated and aggressive.
3) As the fight progresses, the matador stabs and injures the bull with his sword, leading to the bull lying on the ground, visibly injured and struggling to move.
4) The brutal treatment and stabbing cause the bull to be severely wounded, resulting in it being dragged away from the arena, with blood splattered on the ground.
5) The scene then transitions to a slaughterhouse where the bull is processed and butchered, which is a consequence of the bullfighting event.
6) The video ends with a message from PETA, which is prompted by the violent and cruel scenes shown, urging viewers not to support bullfighting.
