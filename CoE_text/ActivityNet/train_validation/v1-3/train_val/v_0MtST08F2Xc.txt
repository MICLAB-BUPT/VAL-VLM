1) The person in the video is raking leaves in a backyard, which causes the fallen leaves to be gathered into piles.
2) The individual is using a rake with a red and yellow design (or simply a red rake), and this tool enables them to effectively gather the scattered leaves.
3) The person is dressed in jeans and a hoodie, an outfit that is suitable for outdoor work, allowing them to comfortably perform the task of raking.
4) The yard has a mix of green grass and brown leaves, along with patches of snow, indicating that it is late autumn or early winter, which is the reason why there are many fallen leaves to be raked.
5) While the person is focused on cleaning up the yard by collecting the leaves, two dogs, one white and one black, are playfully interacting with the leaves, running around energetically, jumping on the leaves, and occasionally getting tangled in the rake, adding a lively and playful atmosphere to the scene.
