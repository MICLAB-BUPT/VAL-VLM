1) The video begins with a close-up of a stainless steel kitchen sink, where a person's hand is seen wiping the surface with a purple cloth, which causes the initial dirt or residue to be removed.
2) The faucet is turned on, and water starts running into the sink, causing the sink to be wet and ready for the next cleaning steps.
3) The person then picks up an orange box labeled 'Arm & Hammer Pure Baking Soda' and pours some into the sink, which causes a chemical reaction when combined with the vinegar that they pour in next, helping to break down any remaining dirt or grime.
4) They use a sponge to scrub the surface, ensuring all areas are cleaned, which causes the baking soda and vinegar mixture to be spread evenly and effectively over the sink.
5) The person rinses the sink thoroughly under running water, causing any remaining cleaning agents and loosened dirt to be washed away.
6) After rinsing, the person uses a white paper towel to dry the sink and faucet, causing the sink to become clean and dry.
7) Finally, the person turns off the faucet and places the purple cloth back on the edge of the sink, signifying the completion of the cleaning process.
