1) The video shows a person, likely a woman based on the voice and appearance of the hands, holding a small kitten in her lap.
2) The woman is attempting to trim the kitten's claws using a pair of red-handled nail clippers, which causes the kitten to struggle or resist the process as indicated by its body language and vocalizations.
3) In another scenario, a person is seen holding a kitten while another individual uses red-handled nail clippers to trim the kitten's claws, causing the kitten to remain calm and cooperative throughout the process.
4) The difference in the kitten's behavior (struggling vs. being calm) is caused by the handling and trimming technique used by the person with the clippers.
