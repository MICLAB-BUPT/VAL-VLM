1) The video shows a man changing the tires of a large truck. He starts by using a power tool to remove the lug nuts from the old tire, which causes the tire to become loose and ready for removal.
2) Then, he lifts the new tire into place and secures it with the lug nuts, leading to the next step where he uses a jack to lift the truck slightly in order to remove the old tire completely.
3) After removing the old tire, he tightens the lug nuts on the new tire with the power tool to ensure it is securely attached, which completes the tire-changing process.
