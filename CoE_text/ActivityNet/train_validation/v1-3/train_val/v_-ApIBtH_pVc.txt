1) The video begins with a close-up view of the interior of a car trunk, showing a black metal frame.
2) A person's hands, which have tattoos on their arms, are seen placing and adjusting the black metal frame to fit properly inside the trunk, causing the preparation for the tire installation.
3) The same person then places a tire into the trunk, positioning it onto the previously adjusted frame, leading to the next step of securing the tire.
4) To ensure the tire is securely fastened, the person uses a tool to tighten the lug nuts, causing the tire to be firmly attached to the frame.
5) After the tire is secured, the person places a gray carpet over it, smoothing it out to cover the entire surface, resulting in the tire being completely hidden.
6) Finally, the person removes the tire from the trunk, revealing the empty space underneath, concluding the sequence of actions.
