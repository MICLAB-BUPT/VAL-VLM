1) The video begins with a black and blue logo animation featuring the text 'Howcast' in blue, which transitions to a title card reading 'HOW TO MAKE RED VELVET CAKE'.
2) This is followed by a close-up of a fork cutting into a red velvet cake, revealing its layers, and then a list of ingredients and equipment needed for the recipe is displayed.
3) The display of ingredients and equipment leads to the demonstration of each step of the recipe, starting with turning on an oven, as the person turns on an oven dial.
4) After the oven is turned on, the next steps include mixing dry ingredients, adding butter and sugar, incorporating eggs, and adding red food coloring, which is shown through pouring and mixing ingredients in a bowl with a hand mixer.
5) The addition and mixing of ingredients cause the batter to be ready, leading to the person transferring the mixture to a baking pan and placing it in the preheated oven to bake the cake.
6) Once the cake is baked, the video includes a tip about using beet juice as a substitute for red food coloring, though this does not affect the already baked cake.
7) The final steps, after the cake has cooled, involve frosting the cake, where the person spreads frosting onto a cake layer and stacks multiple layers of cake and frosting together, smoothing the frosting, and decorating it with pink rose petals.
8) The completion of the cake decoration leads to the video concluding with a historical note about the origin of red velvet cake, followed by the Howcast logo animation.
