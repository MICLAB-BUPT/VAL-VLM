1) The video starts with a woman in a red and white patterned dress standing in a kitchen, talking to the camera. She is seen pouring ingredients, including a yellow liquid, into a pot on the stove, which causes her to begin the preparation of rosemary vodka lemonade.
2) Adding rosemary sprigs to the pot on the stove, she then stirs them with a wooden spoon, causing the mixture to blend and infuse with the flavor of rosemary.
3) After boiling, she pours the yellowish liquid from the pot into glass jars that have been pre-filled with ice, which causes the drink to start cooling down.
4) She adds clear liquid, identified as vodka, from a green bottle into the jars, causing the transformation of the mixture into an alcoholic beverage.
5) The woman is shown adjusting the rosemary sprigs in the jars, ensuring they are properly positioned, which enhances the aesthetic and flavor of the drink.
6) She stirs the mixture and tastes the drink, indicating that the preparation process is complete, which leads to her holding up one of the jars, smiling at the camera, and then transitioning to a screen displaying other recipes to watch.
