1) The video begins with a black screen displaying the text 'kitchentigress.blogspot.com' in white font, accompanied by a white silhouette of a cat, which introduces the source and theme of the content.
2) It transitions to a close-up shot of a yellow cake on a white plate, with a metal tray and another plate with more cake pieces in the background, setting the scene for what will be created.
3) The scene shifts to a bowl containing crumbled yellow cake pieces, indicating the starting point for the recipe, which is caused by the decision to use a pre-made cake as a base ingredient.
4) A hand uses a white electric mixer to blend the cake pieces into a smooth mixture, an action that prepares the base for the new cake, leading to the next steps.
5) The process continues with the addition of eggs, vanilla extract, flour, milk, and baking powder, each ingredient being mixed thoroughly, which causes the formation of the cake batter.
6) The batter is then transferred into a greased rectangular metal pan, spread evenly, and placed inside an oven for baking, a step that initiates the transformation from batter to baked cake due to heat.
7) After baking, the cake is removed from the oven, revealing its golden-brown top, a result of the baking process, signaling the completion of the cake's preparation.
8) The final scene shows the baked cake being sliced and served on a white plate, ready to be enjoyed, which is the ultimate goal and outcome of all the previous actions.
