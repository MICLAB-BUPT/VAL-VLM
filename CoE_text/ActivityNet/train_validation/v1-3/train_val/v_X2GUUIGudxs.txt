1) The man in a blue shirt and jeans starts applying a large, detailed wall decal to a white wall, which features a cityscape with illuminated buildings against a dark purple background, along with a gold map of the United States.
2) He uses a squeegee tool to smooth out the decal, ensuring it adheres properly without air bubbles or wrinkles, causing the decal to stick firmly and smoothly to the wall.
3) The man carefully aligns the edges of the decal with the wall's corners, making precise adjustments as he works his way across the surface, leading to a well-aligned and aesthetically pleasing result.
4) As the application nears completion, he cuts the wallpaper along the edge of the wall using a utility knife, resulting in a clean and professional finish.
