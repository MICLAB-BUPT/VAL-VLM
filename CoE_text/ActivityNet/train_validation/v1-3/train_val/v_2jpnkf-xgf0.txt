1) The woman, wearing a pink apron and a green shirt, is in a kitchen setting preparing to make cookies on a silicone baking mat.
2) She begins by rolling out the dough with a white rolling pin, which causes the dough to become flat and even.
3) After the dough is rolled out, she uses a metal scraper to cut lines into the dough, which allows her to create smaller, manageable pieces.
4) She then uses different cookie cutters, including a bear shape, to cut out shapes from the dough, causing the creation of various cookie shapes.
5) The cut-out shapes are placed onto the silicone mat, which prepares them for the next step.
6) In one version, she dips a brush into a yellow bowl containing a red liquid, likely jam or jelly, and spreads it onto the bear-shaped cookie, which adds flavor and color to the cookies.
7) In another version, she decorates the cookies by placing small red candies inside some of the cut-out shapes, which also enhances the appearance and taste of the cookies.
