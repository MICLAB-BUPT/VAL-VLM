1) The video shows a man drying a young child's hair with a hair dryer, causing the child's hair to become dry.
2) The child is wrapped in a blue towel, indicating that the child has just had a bath or shower which caused their hair to be wet.
3) The man is using a silver hair dryer and a brush, suggesting that he is both drying and styling the child's hair, which causes the hair to be more manageable and neat.
