1) The video begins with a title screen displaying 'PARADE MAGAZINE' and the website, which transitions to an image of a carved pumpkin with a cat face design.
2) This scene causes the display of instructions on a black background, detailing the first step of carving a 6-inch circle around the pumpkin's pulp and printing a stencil from Parade.com.
3) Following the instructions, the person starts by cutting off the top of the pumpkin, causing them to hollow it out and remove the seeds and pulp.
4) After hollowing, the person uses a sharp pin and the printed stencil to trace the design onto the pumpkin, which leads to carefully cutting along the lines with a serrated knife to create the cat face design.
5) The tracing and cutting cause the person to then carve triangular ears into the pumpkin using toothpicks as guides.
6) The use of toothpicks as guides allows the person to attach the carved ears to the top of the pumpkin, completing the cat face design.
7) Finally, the completed pumpkin is showcased on a table, leading to the conclusion of the video with a message 'Happy Halloween' and the 'PARADE MAGAZINE' logo.
