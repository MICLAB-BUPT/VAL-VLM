1) The video features a bartender at a bar counter, preparing a drink. She starts by placing a mason jar on the counter.
2) This action is followed by her adding ice cubes from a metal pitcher, which causes the jar to be prepared for the cold ingredients and liquids.
3) Next, she pours a clear liquid from a bottle into the jar, causing the base of the drink to be established.
4) The bartender then adds a yellowish liquid from another bottle, which causes the flavor and color of the drink to change.
