The two answers provided describe different scenarios and cannot be logically integrated into a single coherent event. Each answer describes the men engaging in a distinct game (cricket in the first, croquet in the second) and there are other discrepancies such as the presence of photographs in the second scenario which are not mentioned in the first. Therefore, it is not possible to establish a logical chain between these two events as they appear to be separate and unrelated.
