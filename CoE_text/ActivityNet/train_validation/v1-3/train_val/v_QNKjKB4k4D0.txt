2) A cowboy on horseback is seen chasing a calf across a dusty arena, causing the environment to appear dry and dusty, typical of a rodeo setting.
3) The cowboy, wearing a light blue shirt, dark pants, and a cowboy hat, successfully lassos the calf, which leads to him dismounting his horse.
4) After dismounting, the cowboy wrestles the calf to the ground, then ties its legs together with a rope, resulting in the calf being immobilized.
5) The horse stands nearby as the cowboy completes his task, and after finishing, the cowboy stands up and walks away from the calf, which remains tied on the ground.
