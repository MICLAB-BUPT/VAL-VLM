1) A group of children, including three girls, is playing on a sandy beach near the water's edge, causing them to be engaged in building something with sand, possibly a sandcastle or fort.
2) The environment is bright and sunny, suggesting it's daytime, which causes the children to be dressed in swimwear suitable for beach activities.
3) The girl in the middle, wearing a green bikini, is kneeling down and using her hands to shape the sand, while the girl to her left, in a black swimsuit, is also kneeling and using her hands to mold the sand, indicating they are actively participating in the construction.
4) On the right side, a girl in a pink swimsuit is sitting on the sand, holding a blue bowl, and appears to be observing or waiting for her turn, suggesting she is part of the group but not currently involved in the shaping process.
5) Various objects, such as a blue bowl, a white plastic cup, and some sandals, are scattered around them, providing the necessary tools and accessories for their activity.
6) The ocean waves can be heard gently crashing onto the shore in the background, adding to the serene atmosphere, which contributes to the overall enjoyment and focus of the children on their task.
