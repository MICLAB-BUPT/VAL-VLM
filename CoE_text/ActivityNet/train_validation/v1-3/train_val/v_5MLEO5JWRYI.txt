1) The video begins with a title screen introducing the topic of cleaning a sink drain using baking soda and vinegar.
2) The scene transitions to a bathroom sink where a person pours baking soda into the drain, causing the initial setup for the cleaning process.
3) The person then pours vinegar from a large white container into the drain, which causes a foamy reaction as it bubbles in the sink due to the chemical interaction between the baking soda and vinegar.
4) To ensure the mixture is well combined, the person uses a small orange box to stir the mixture, enhancing the effectiveness of the cleaning action.
5) The person continues to pour more vinegar into the sink, causing more vigorous bubbling, further deepening the cleaning process.
6) After the bubbling subsides, the person uses a sponge to scrub the inside of the sink, removing any remaining residue and completing the cleaning process.
