1) The video showcases a person working on a car tire, using various tools to remove and replace the rubber. Initially, the tire is mounted on a rim with a metal rod in the center.
2) The person, wearing blue gloves, uses a tool to pry off the rubber from the rim, rotating it as they work, which causes the rubber to separate from the rim, revealing the inner structure of the tire.
3) They then proceed to remove the rubber completely, exposing the tire's sidewall, and place the old tire aside.
4) Next, they apply lubricant to the rim using a brush, ensuring it is evenly coated, which facilitates the smooth mounting of the new tire.
5) Afterward, they place a new piece of rubber onto the rim, carefully aligning it with the metal rod, and use a tool to press down on the rubber to secure it in place.
6) Finally, they rotate the tire to ensure even pressure distribution before removing the tool and inspecting their work, which ensures that the tire is properly and securely mounted.
