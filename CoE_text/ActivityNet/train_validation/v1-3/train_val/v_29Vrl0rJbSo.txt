1) A woman with long brown hair, wearing a white t-shirt and a necklace, is standing in a bathroom.
2) She begins by brushing her wet hair with a round brush, which causes her to start the process of styling her hair.
3) Simultaneously, she uses a white hairdryer with black accents, which allows her to dry her hair while brushing.
4) The combination of brushing and drying causes her hair to become smooth and styled.
5) Her actions are methodical and focused, ensuring that her hair is evenly styled and dried.
6) Occasionally, she looks at the camera and speaks, but this does not interrupt her primary goal of achieving a smooth and dry hairstyle.
