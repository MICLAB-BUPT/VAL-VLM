1) The video starts with a woman in a black polo shirt standing against a plain wall, speaking to the camera.
2) She then demonstrates wallpaper removal by peeling off a strip of wallpaper from a wall using a scraper tool, which causes the floral patterned wallpaper to start coming off.
3) To make the process easier, she uses a spray bottle to apply water to the remaining wallpaper, causing it to loosen and become more manageable for removal.
4) The person continues to scrape and peel off the wallpaper, working their way down the wall, revealing the bare wall underneath.
5) Next, she uses a squeegee to smooth out the wallpaper, ensuring it adheres properly, but since the wallpaper is being removed, this step actually does not fit within the logical sequence; thus, it should be disregarded in the context of removing wallpaper.
6) She applies a cleaning solution to the wall and wipes it down with a cloth, causing the surface to be cleaned and prepped.
7) Finally, she uses a scraper again to remove any remaining pieces of wallpaper, leaving the wall clean and ready for painting or further decoration.
