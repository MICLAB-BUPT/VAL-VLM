1) The man, dressed in a dark blue t-shirt, black pants with white stripes, and white sneakers, is seated on a red bench in the gym, which sets the stage for his stretching exercise.
2) He begins by extending his right leg forward and bending his left leg at the knee, resting it on the bench, causing him to lean forward and reach towards his right foot with both hands. This action is aimed at stretching his legs and back muscles.
3) Holding this stretch for several seconds, he then switches to the other side, causing him to extend his left leg and bend his right leg, now reaching towards his left foot, maintaining a steady pace and controlled movements throughout.
4) In another sequence of the same video, the man adjusts his position, causing both of his legs to be extended forward, but one foot rests on the floor while the other leg is bent at the knee, with the foot placed on the opposite thigh, setting up for a different stretch.
5) Leaning forward and reaching towards his toes, he stretches his hamstrings. Raising both arms above his head and holding this new position for a few seconds, he further intensifies the stretch before returning to the starting position.
6) The repetition of these sequences, including alternating between sides and raising his arms, causes a thorough and balanced stretching routine, focusing on flexibility and muscle elongation.
