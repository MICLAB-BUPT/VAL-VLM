1) The video starts with a person in a blue apron operating the K-T Micro Wax Machine, which causes the individual to adjust the settings and prepare it for use.
2) After preparing the machine, the individual then places a ski onto the machine's rollers, causing him to carefully guide the ski through the rollers to ensure an even wax application.
3) The careful guidance of the ski through the rollers, while applying light pressure on the wax roller and moving the ski slowly, results in a smooth, evenly waxed surface.
4) The process involves maintaining the correct temperature and not touching the hot roll, which ensures safety and the efficiency of the waxing process, leading to the continuous application of liquid wax at 160 degrees Celsius.
5) The demonstration of the finished waxed ski, showcasing the smooth and even surface, is a consequence of following the proper technique and precautions throughout the waxing process.
