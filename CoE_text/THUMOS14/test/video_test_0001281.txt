1) The man's interaction with the camera, including talking and gesturing, causes him to prepare for the long jump.  
2) Preparing leads to him standing on the runway, taking steps forward, and leaping into the air.  
3) The fluid and controlled movements during the jump result in a smooth takeoff and a successful landing in the sand pit.  
4) Landing in the sand pit causes him to stand up and walk back toward the starting point.  
5) Walking back leads to either preparing for another attempt or observing his performance.
