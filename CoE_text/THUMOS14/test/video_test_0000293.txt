1) The woman begins by demonstrating the correct grip technique, which causes proper control and positioning of the javelin.  
2) Holding the javelin high over her right shoulder leads to optimal balance and preparation for the throwing motion.  
3) The running and acceleration phase causes increased momentum, which is essential for generating power during the throw.  
4) Crossing the left leg over the right during final strides results in a stable base, allowing for efficient force transfer.  
5) Planting the left leg and pushing off with the right leg leads to a powerful rotational movement that propels the javelin forward.  
6) Keeping the arm straight and at shoulder height during the throw results in a streamlined motion, maximizing release speed.  
7) Releasing the javelin while the throwing hand is ahead and high causes the projectile to achieve maximum distance and accuracy.  
8) The complete follow-through after release ensures proper body alignment and minimizes the risk of injury.
