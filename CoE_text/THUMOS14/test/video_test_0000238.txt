1) The woman golfer, dressed in a black top, yellow pants, and a white visor, is on a sunny day at a golf course with lush green grass, which causes her to prepare to take a shot.  
2) Her stance with feet shoulder-width apart and holding the club behind her head leads to her swinging the club forward.  
3) The swing results in striking the ball, sending it flying through the air, and the follow-through occurs as she watches the ball travel down the fairway.
