1) The man prepares to jump off the cliff, which causes him to take a running leap and dive into the water, creating a large splash.  
2) The splash leads to the camera panning down to the rocky shoreline and waves crashing against the rocks, while the man resurfaces and swims toward the shore.  
3) Climbing out of the water onto the rocks results in him walking back up to the cliff to prepare for another jump.  
4) The second jump, caused by his repeated action, leads to him flipping in the air before landing in the water, which results in another splash.  
5) Swimming back to the shore and climbing out of the water leads to the video ending with him standing on the cliff, looking out at the ocean.
