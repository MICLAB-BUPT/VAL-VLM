1) The video starts with a title screen displaying 'Expert Village' and 'Golf,' which causes the transition to a man on a golf course, establishing the instructional context.  
2) The man's attire—blue polo shirt and beige pants—along with the clear sky and green grass, leads to a setting that emphasizes fair weather and a well-maintained golf course.  
3) His demonstration of golf swings, including stance, grip, and swing mechanics, results in an emphasis on proper form and technique, which is further reinforced by his deliberate movements.  
4) Addressing the camera and performing full swings alternately leads to a structured explanation of each swing phase, such as backswing, downswing, and follow-through.  
5) The use of hand gestures and body movements to illustrate techniques results in a clearer understanding of golfing mechanics for viewers.  
6) The combination of visual elements (pile of golf balls, green field) and the man's instructional focus ultimately leads to the video's purpose of educating viewers on effective golfing techniques.
