1) Athletes prepare for their long jump attempts, which causes them to sprint down the track and take off from the board.  
2) Their takeoff leads to leaps into the sandpit, with the video capturing these movements from close-ups and wide shots.  
3) The intensity and focus of the competitors result in varied jump distances, which officials measure and record.  
4) The measured distances, combined with scoreboard graphics, lead to the display of athletes' names, countries, and performance metrics.  
5) The outdoor stadium environment, along with spectators in the stands, creates a dynamic setting that enhances the competitive atmosphere.  
6) The sequence of events, from preparation to measurement, results in the continuous progression of the long jump competition.
