1) The golfer, dressed in a blue shirt and white cap, prepares to take a shot on a golf course, causing him to adjust his stance and focus on the ball.  
2) This adjustment leads to the execution of a swing, which results in the ball being hit after the golfer uses a golf club.  
3) The background, featuring trees, a green tent, and a sign with 'BANCA' and 'Canyon' logos, remains consistent during the action, while slight differences in attire (dark polo shirt vs. blue shirt) and signage (‘BANCA Cívica’ vs. ‘BANCA’) may indicate contextual variations.  
4) The overcast lighting and well-maintained grass create a stable environment, leading to the golfer’s focused and controlled swing.
