1) The presence of a barbell loaded with weights in the gym causes the man to initiate the weightlifting exercise.  
2) His bending down to grip the barbell leads to lifting it off the ground, which causes the barbell to be raised above his head in a controlled manner.  
3) The act of raising the barbell overhead results in the need to lower it back to the floor, as part of the structured movement sequence.  
4) Lowering the barbell leads to him stepping away from it, completing the exercise and concluding the action.  
5) The gym's equipment and safety mats facilitate the safe execution of the movement, ensuring the process is carried out without incident.
