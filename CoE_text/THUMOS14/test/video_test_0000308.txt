1) The athlete's preparation, including warm-up exercises, causes her to be physically ready for high jump attempts.  
2) Her practice of a three-step approach leads to improved technique, which results in successfully clearing the high jump bar.  
3) The coach's guidance, such as demonstrating movements and providing feedback, causes the athlete to refine her form.  
4) The athlete's execution of a scissor jump, where she crosses her legs mid-air, results in a controlled landing on the red mat.  
5) Interaction with the coach, discussing performance, leads to iterative adjustments in her technique, which enhances her overall high jump efficiency.  
6) The repeated successful attempts and technical refinements result in the athlete's effective training session on the red track.
