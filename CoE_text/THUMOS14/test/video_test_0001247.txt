1) A man in a red polo shirt and blue jeans stands beside a pool table, holding a cue stick, which causes him to demonstrate how to take a shot in pool.  
2) His demonstration leads him to aim the cue stick at the pink ball, resulting in him taking a shot that hits the ball across the table.  
3) The shot causes the pink ball to move, which leads him to walk around the table to inspect the positions of the remaining balls.  
4) While inspecting the results, he gestures and points at the balls, which explains the game's mechanics to an observer.  
5) The presence of two balls on the table (pink and white) results in the need to assess their positions after the shot.
