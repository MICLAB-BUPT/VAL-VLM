1) The man sets up pole vaulting equipment in his backyard, which causes him to prepare the poles and adjust the bar for the jump.  
2) Preparing the equipment leads to him running toward the vaulting area, holding the pole, which causes him to plant the pole into the ground.  
3) Planting the pole results in launching himself upwards, leading to a successful clearance of the bar.  
4) The successful clearance of the bar leads to him landing on the mat, completing the pole vaulting attempt.  
5) The entire process results in demonstrating focus, strength, and agility through his execution of the technique.
