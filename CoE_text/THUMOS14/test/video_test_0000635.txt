1) A person is performing a power clean and jerk exercise in an indoor gym setting, which causes them to start with the barbell on the floor.  
2) Lifting the barbell from the floor to their shoulders (the 'clean') leads to a swift motion that positions the weight for the next phase of the lift.  
3) The subsequent explosive overhead lift (the 'jerk') results in the individual dropping into a squat position to stabilize the barbell.  
4) Stabilizing the weight overhead causes the person to stand up straight, completing the lift and returning to an upright posture.  
5) The bright fluorescent lighting and rubber mat flooring in the gym environment support the athlete's movements by providing clear visibility and a safe, non-slip surface.
