1) The video shows a person playing pool in an indoor setting, likely a home, which causes the player to use a standard-sized pool table with blue felt.  
2) The balls are arranged in a triangle formation at one end of the table, which leads to the player using a cue stick to strike them, resulting in the balls being scattered across the table.  
3) The player, dressed in dark clothing, takes deliberate and focused shots, aiming the white cue ball toward colored balls to pocket them, which causes the game to progress dynamically.  
4) Artificial lighting from ceiling fixtures illuminates the scene, ensuring visibility of the table and the player's precise movements, which enhances the overall gameplay experience.
