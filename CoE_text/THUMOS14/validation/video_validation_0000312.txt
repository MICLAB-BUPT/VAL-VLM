1) The video showcases a discus throwing event, starting with an athlete in a red and white uniform preparing inside a caged area, which causes the camera to capture his preparation.  
2) His spinning motion during the discus throw leads to the mid-throw clip, resulting in the athlete releasing the discus into the air.  
3) The camera movement or focus issues cause blurred shots of the field, which leads to the next clip showing another athlete in a similar uniform preparing for a throw.  
4) The second athlete’s preparation results in another blurred field shot, followed by a different athlete in a pink and black uniform walking away from the cage.  
5) The event transitions to a hammer throw, where a male athlete in a red and white uniform spins to gain momentum, causing the hammer to be released and fly through the air.  
6) The camera follows the hammer’s trajectory until it lands, leading officials to measure the distance of the throw.  
7) The athlete’s reaction to his performance results in the scoreboard displaying the final results, which includes both the discus and hammer throw outcomes.
