1) The golfer's attire and the well-manicured golf course setting cause the scene to appear professional, as indicated by sponsor signs like 'Abasturismo' and 'Golf'.  
2) The golfer's focused preparation and precise swing lead to the ball being struck with accuracy, resulting in a visible trajectory.  
3) The clear sky and shadows cast on the ground lead to the conclusion that the event occurs during morning or afternoon.  
4) The background's green grass, trees, and blue sky, combined with the golfer walking away from the tee box, result in a cohesive depiction of a semi-professional golf activity.
