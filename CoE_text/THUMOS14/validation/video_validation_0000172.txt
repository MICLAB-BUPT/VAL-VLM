1) The man in a white shirt and black shorts is practicing cricket, which causes him to run back and forth on the indoor sports field.  
2) This running back and forth leads to simulating bowling actions, as indicated by his repeated motions toward and away from the camera.  
3) The presence of cricket stumps and balls scattered on the field results in a dedicated practice environment for training drills.  
4) The green artificial turf and surrounding nets, which are part of the indoor facility, provide a structured space for the practice.  
5) The scattered colored cones and markers, along with plain walls and artificial lighting, result in a controlled setting optimized for cricket training.
