1) The video showcases a cricket match in progress, featuring a batsman from the Sri Lanka team. The batsman is seen preparing to face a delivery, adjusting his stance and grip on the bat. This causes him to take a swing at the ball, hitting it with considerable force.  
2) The trajectory of the ball, which results in it traveling across the field, eventually reaches the boundary for four runs. This leads to the batsman celebrating the successful shot by raising his bat in acknowledgment of the crowd's applause.  
3) In contrast, the video also showcases a cricket match in progress, where the batsman prepares to face a delivery, adjusting his stance and holding the bat firmly.

4) The batsman is seen walking away from the pitch, possibly after being dismissed or taking a break, which results in the video capturing the intensity of the game, focusing on the actions of the players involved in the play.
