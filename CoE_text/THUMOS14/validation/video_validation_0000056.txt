1) The video begins with a title screen, which introduces the topic of "The Physics of Billiards."  
2) The person arranges the balls into a triangular formation, which sets up the initial configuration for the game.  
3) Striking the cue ball causes the balls to scatter across the table, leading to collisions and movement.  
4) The player's precise aiming and varied angles during shots result in successful pocketing of balls.  
5) The demonstration of different formations (triangle and line) leads to varied trajectories and interactions between the balls.  
6) The warm lighting and home setting provide a consistent environment throughout the video.
