1) The athlete's preparation causes him to bend down and grip the barbell with red weights on each side.  
2) This action leads to lifting the barbell from the ground to his shoulders (clean) and then pushing it overhead (jerk).  
3) Successfully completing the lift results in the athlete dropping the barbell and celebrating with a raised arm.  
4) The gym's environment, including a red bulletin board, a television screen, and the sign "The First Cadets in the City," sets the scene for the event.  
5) Spectators in the background, both seated and standing, observe the lift, contributing to the atmosphere of the weightlifting competition.
