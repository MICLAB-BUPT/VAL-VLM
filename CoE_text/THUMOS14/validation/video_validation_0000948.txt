1) The athlete begins by standing on the circular platform, which causes him to spin to gain momentum.  
2) The spinning motion leads to his body leaning forward and his left arm extending for balance.  
3) This balanced spin results in the release of the discus with a powerful throw.  
4) The release causes the discus to fly through the air, resulting in it landing far down the field.
