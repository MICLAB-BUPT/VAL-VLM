1) A player in a gray uniform is hit by a pitch, causing him to fall to the ground. This leads to the umpire signaling that the player is out, and the pitcher walks away from the plate.  
2) Meanwhile, Niese, a Braves player, hits the ball and runs toward first base, but he trips over another player sliding into home plate, resulting in an injury. This causes medical personnel to attend to the injured player, who is then escorted off the field by a coach.  
3) The injured player from the first incident is helped up by a teammate and walks toward the dugout, while the injured player from the second incident is assisted off the field. Both events lead to the game continuing with other players preparing for their turn at bat.
